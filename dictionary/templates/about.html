    <p class="w3-xlarge">Wordier: From Dad to the World</p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; text-align: justify; padding: 0 20px;">
        <p><strong>Story: </strong>Wordier wasn't always the app you know today. It began as a simple idea – a dad wanting to make learning English fun for his daughter. In late 2020, "Vocgo" (Wordier's former name) launched on the App Store and Google Play. What started as exercises for one soon became a hit with friends and family.</p>
        <p><strong>Growth: </strong>As his daughter blossomed, so did Wordier. New features were added, like 'hangman' which is perfect for those long car trips.  Wordier also introduced some structured vocab modules that suit different age groups, such as 500 Elementary Words, etc.</p>
