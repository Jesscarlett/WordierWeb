    <p>Know that if you come to this page, you must be interested in Wordier and its creater. Wordier was launched on Apple store and Google place in late 2020, old name is 'Vocgo'. The original intent was simply to prepare exercises and English learning for the creater's daughter.</p>
    <p>It became popular, friends and families saw value using the app. As the daughter grew, more and more senior features were added as well as games. Hangman is great especially when you and family are on a long boring car trip.</p>
    <p>This website was created to host more complex vocabulary and writing exercises which are difficult to perform on a mobile.</p>
    <p>Both the Wordier app and the site are free, and don't require user information. So enjoy! </p>
