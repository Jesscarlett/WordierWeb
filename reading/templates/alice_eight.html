    <p class="w3-large"><strong>CHAPTER VIII. The Queen’s Croquet-Ground - Part 1</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
        <p>A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses
        growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily
        painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she
        went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard
        one of them say, “Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me
        like that!”</p>
        <p>“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my
        elbow.”</p>
        <p>On which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five! Always lay the
        blame on others!”</p>
        <p>“<em>You’d</em> better not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only
        yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!”</p>
        <p>“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.</p>
        <p>“That’s none of <em>your</em> business, Two!” said Seven.</p>
        <p>“Yes, it <em>is</em> his business!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for
        bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”</p>
        <p>Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust
        things—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching
        them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,
        and all of them bowed low.</p>
        <p>“Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you are
        painting those roses?”</p>
        <p>Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low
        voice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a
        red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen
        was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So
        you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this
        moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called
        out “The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw
        themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,
        and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.</p>
        <p>First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the
        three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the
        corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
        diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came
        the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
        jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all
        ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,
        and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a
        hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went
        by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying
        the King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this
        grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.</p>
        <p>Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a procession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So she stood still where she was, and waited.</p>
        <p>When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely “Who is this?” She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.</p>
        <p>“Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went on, “What’s your name, child?”</p>
        <p>“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely; but she added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after all. I needn’t be afraid of them!”</p>
        <p>“And who are these?” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children. </p>

        <p>2. The three gardeners are individuals who are painting the roses on a rose-tree red.</p>
        <p>3. They are painting the roses red because they accidentally planted a white rose-tree in a place where a red one should have been, and if the Queen finds out, they will have their heads cut off.</p>

        <p>“How should _I_ know?” said Alice, surprised at her own courage. “It’s
        no business of mine.”</p>
        <p>The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
        moment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head! Off—”</p>
        <p>“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was
        silent.</p>
        <p>The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my
        dear: she is only a child!”</p>
        <p>The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn
        them over!”</p>
        <p>The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.</p>
        <p>“Get up!” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three
        gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,
        the royal children, and everybody else.</p>
        <p>“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You make me giddy.” And then,
        turning to the rose-tree, she went on, “What _have_ you been doing
        here?”</p>
        <p>“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going
        down on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”</p>
        <p>“_I_ see!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.
        “Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on, three of the
        soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran
        to Alice for protection.</p>
        <p>“You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large
        flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a
        minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the
        others.</p>
        <p>“Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.</p>
        <p>“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers shouted
        in reply.</p>
        <p>“That’s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you play croquet?”</p>
        <p>The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
        evidently meant for her.</p>
        <p>“Yes!” shouted Alice.</p>
        <p>“Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,
        wondering very much what would happen next.</p>
        <p>“It’s—it’s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side. She was
        walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.</p>
        <p>“Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?”</p>
        <p>“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked
        anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon
        tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’s under
        sentence of execution.”</p>
        <p>“What for?” said Alice.</p>
        <p>“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.</p>
        <p>“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said
        ‘What for?’”</p>
        <p>“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.</p>
        <p>“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said
        ‘What for?’”</p>
        <p>“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little
        scream of laughter. “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened
        tone. “The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the
        Queen said—”</p>
        <p>“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
        people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
        other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
        began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground
        in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live
        hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double
        themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.</p>
        <p>The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:
        she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,
        under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she
        had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the
        hedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look
        up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help
        bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was
        going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog
        had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all
        this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she
        wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were
        always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice
        soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.</p>

        <p>1. "Turned crimson with fury" means the Queen's face became red with anger.</p>
        <p>2. The three gardeners escaped by jumping up and bowing to the King, Queen, and royal children when the Queen ordered the Knave to turn them over.</p>
        <p>3. Croquet is a lawn game where players use mallets to hit balls through hoops (also known as wickets) embedded in the grass playing court.</p>
        <p>4. In the passage, the croquet game is played with live flamingos as mallets and hedgehogs as balls, which is a strange and unusual variation of the game.</p>
        <p>5. Alice concluded that croquet was a difficult game because the playing field was constantly changing and the rules were not consistent. Additionally, the flamingo mallets kept flying away and the hedgehog balls kept getting up and running away.</p>
        <p>6. Anxiously - feeling or showing worry, nervousness, or unease about something with an uncertain outcome. Example sentence: She waited anxiously for her test results to come in.</p>
        <p>Tumbled - to fall suddenly and clumsily. Example sentence: The books tumbled off the shelf and onto the floor.</p>
        <p>Ridges - a long, narrow, raised strip of land or a raised strip in a surface. Example sentence: The hiker climbed over the ridge to get a better view.</p>
        <p>7. Personification: "just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it would twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression." The author gives the live flamingo mallets and live hedgehog balls human-like qualities by suggesting they have a puzzled expression.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>CHAPTER VIII. The Queen’s Croquet-Ground - Part 3</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
        <p>The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
        all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time
        the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and
        shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a
        minute.</p>
        <p>Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any
        dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,
        “and then,” thought she, “what would become of me? They’re dreadfully
        fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any
        one left alive!”</p>
        <p>She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
        could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious
        appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after
        watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said
        to herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk
        to.”</p>
        <p>“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth
        enough for it to speak with.</p>
        <p>Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use
        speaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one
        of them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put
        down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
        she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there
        was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.</p>
        <p>“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a
        complaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear
        oneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at
        least, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how
        confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the
        arch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
        ground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only
        it ran away when it saw mine coming!”</p>
        <p>“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.</p>
        <p>“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed
        that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,
        “—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”</p>
        <p>The Queen smiled and passed on.</p>
        <p>“Who _are_ you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and
        looking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.</p>
        <p>“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to
        introduce it.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may
        kiss my hand if it likes.”</p>
        <p>“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.</p>
        <p>“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like
        that!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.</p>
        <p>“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read that in some book,
        but I don’t remember where.”</p>
        <p>“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly, and he called
        the Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish you would
        have this cat removed!”</p>
        <p>The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or
        small. “Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.</p>
        <p>“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he
        hurried off.</p>
        <p>Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going
        on, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with
        passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be
        executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look
        of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
        whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.</p>
        <p>The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
        to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
        other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to
        the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a
        helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.</p>
        <p>By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
        was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t
        matter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side
        of the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not
        escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her
        friend.</p>
        <p>When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite
        a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between
        the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
        while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle
        the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they
        all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
        what they said.</p>
        <p>The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless
        there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a
        thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at _his_ time of life.</p>
        <p>The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be
        beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.</p>
        <p>The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in
        less than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was
        this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and
        anxious.)</p>
        <p>Alice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the
        Duchess: you’d better ask _her_ about it.”</p>
        <p>“She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.”
        And the executioner went off like an arrow.</p>
        <p>The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the
        time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so
        the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,
        while the rest of the party went back to the game.</p>

        <p>2. The king asked to behead the cat because he did not like the look of it.</p>

        <p>4. The executioner, the king, and the queen were arguing about the fate of the Cheshire Cat, which the King had asked to be removed, and the Queen had ordered to be executed.</p>

        <p>7. Based on the passage, the king's personality appears to be indecisive and easily influenced by others, such as the queen, whom he eagerly obeyed when she ordered the execution of the Cheshire Cat.</p>
