    <p class="w3-large"><strong>CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole - Part 1</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
        <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
        bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
        the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
        conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice
        “without pictures or conversations?”</p>
        <p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
        hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
        making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
        picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
        close by her.</p>
        <p>There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
        so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh
        dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,
        it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
        time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a
        watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried
        on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
        had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
        watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
        field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
        large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>
        <p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
        in the world she was to get out again.</p>
        <p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
        dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
        about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very
        deep well.</p>
        <p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
        plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what
        was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out
        what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
        looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
        cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
        hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she
        passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great
        disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
        of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the
        cupboards as she fell past it.</p>
        <p>“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall
        think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me
        at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the
        top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)</p>
        <p>Down, down, down. Would the fall <i>never</i> come to an end? “I wonder how
        many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be
        getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would
        be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt
        several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and
        though this was not a <i>very</i> good opportunity for showing off her
        knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good
        practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but
        then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no
        idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice
        grand words to say.)</p>
        <p>Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right <i>through</i>
        the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk
        with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather
        glad there <i>was</i> no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all
        the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the
        country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”
        (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy <i>curtseying</i> as you’re
        falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what
        an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do
        to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”</p>

    <div class="w3-row-padding" id="answer_message1" style="display: none; margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
        <p>1. The story seems to be a fantasy or adventure story, with a young girl named Alice as the main character.</p>
        <p>2. There are several language devices used in the story, including personification (the White Rabbit saying to itself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!"), repetition (Alice wondering about the rabbit's waistcoat-pocket and watch), and hyperbole (Alice imagining falling off the top of a house).</p>
        <p>3. Alice followed the rabbit because she was curious about it, especially after seeing it take a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, which she found unusual.</p>
        <p>4. While she was going down in the rabbit hole, Alice thought about several things, including the depth of the hole, her location relative to the center of the earth, and the possibility of falling right through the earth and coming out in a different country.</p>
        <p>5. Longitude and latitude are geographic coordinates used to specify a location on the Earth's surface. Longitude refers to the east-west position, while latitude refers to the north-south position. Example sentence: The coordinates of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France are 48.8584° N, 2.2945° E, with "N" indicating its latitude north of the equator and "E" indicating its longitude east of the Prime Meridian.</p>
        <p>6. The answer can various. It's difficult to say whether Alice is a good student at school based on this excerpt alone, but it does suggest that she has learned some things in her lessons, even if she doesn't fully understand them (such as longitude and latitude). She also seems curious and imaginative, which could be qualities of a good student.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole - Part 2</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
        <p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!” (Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p>
        <p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.</p>
        <p>There were doors all-round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p>
        <p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p>
        <p> Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.</p>
        <p>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p>
        <p>It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was not going to do _that_ in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they _would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.</p>
        <p>However, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.</p>

    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
        <p>“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a
        telescope.”</p>
        <p>And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
        brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
        through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
        waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
        she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”
        said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I
        wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the
        flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could
        not remember ever having seen such a thing.</p>
        <p>After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
        into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
        door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
        went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
        it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
        best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
        and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
        sat down and cried.</p>
        <p>“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself,
        rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally
        gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),
        and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
        her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
        cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
        for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
        “But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two
        people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable
        person!”</p>
        <p>Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
        she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words
        “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said
        Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
        makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll
        get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”</p>
        <p>She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which
        way?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
        growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
        size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
        had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
        things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go
        on in the common way.</p>
