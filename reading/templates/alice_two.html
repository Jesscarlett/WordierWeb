    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
        <p>“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that
        for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m
        opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!”
        (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of
        sight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I
        wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m
        sure _I_ shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
        myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be
        kind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I
        want to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every
        Christmas.”</p>
        <p>And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must
        go by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending
        presents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!</p>
        <p>Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,(with
             Alice’s love).</p>
        <p>Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”</p>
        <p>Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was
        now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden
        key and hurried off to the garden door.</p>
        <p>Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
        look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
        hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.</p>
        <p>“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like
        you,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop
        this moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding
        gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about
        four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.</p>
        <p>After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
        she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
        Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves
        in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a
        great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the
        Duchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt
        so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the
        Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please,
        sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and
        the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.</p>
        <p>Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
        kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How
        queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
        I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the
        same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling
        a little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who
        in the world am I? Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!” And she began
        thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as
        herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.</p>

    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
        <p>“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long
        ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t
        be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
        very little! Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how
        puzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.
        Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,
        and four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that
        rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try
        Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of
        Rome, and Rome—no, _that’s_ all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been
        changed for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘_How doth the little_—’” and she
        crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began
        to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words
        did not come the same as they used to do:—</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">“How doth the little crocodile </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Improve his shining tail,</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">And pour the waters of the Nile</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">On every golden scale!</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">“How cheerfully he seems to grin,</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">How neatly spread his claws,</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">And welcome little fishes in</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">With gently smiling jaws!”</p>
        <p>“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes
        filled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and
        I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
        no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve
        made up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be
        no use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’
        I shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and
        then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down
        here till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden
        burst of tears, “I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so
        _very_ tired of being all alone here!”</p>
        <p>As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
        that she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while
        she was talking. “How _can_ I have done that?” she thought. “I must be
        growing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure
        herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was
        now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon
        found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she
        dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.</p>
        <p>“That _was_ a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
        sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and
        now for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little
        door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden
        key was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than
        ever,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this
        before, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”</p>
        <p>As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,
        splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that
        she had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by
        railway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
        her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
        to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
        sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
        of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she
        soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when
        she was nine feet high.</p>

        <p>The passage is a fun and imaginative. It describes Alice's confusion and anxiety as she tries to figure out who she is and what is happening to her in a strange and nonsensical world.</p>
        <p>Alice shrinks in size and falls into a pool of tears that she had previously cried when she was nine feet tall.</p>
        <p>No, Alice does not seem to have a good grasp of math and geography as she struggles to remember basic facts and gets them wrong. Her confusion and frustration add to the humorous tone of the passage.</p>
        <p>There are several examples of imagery in the passage, such as "pour the waters of the Nile on every golden scale" and "neatly spread his claws." These descriptions help create vivid mental images in the reader's mind.</p>
        <p>Alice initially thinks she fell into the sea because she is disoriented and confused about her surroundings. She tries to rationalize her situation by using her limited knowledge of the world around her.</p>
        <p>Alice actually falls into a pool of tears that she had previously cried when she was nine feet tall. This is a surreal and fantastical element of the story that adds to its whimsy and charm.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears -  Part 3</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
        <p>“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying
        to find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
        being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be
        sure! However, everything is queer to-day.”</p>
        <p>Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
        off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought
        it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small
        she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
        slipped in like herself.</p>
        <p>“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?
        Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
        likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she
        began: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
        of swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right
        way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but
        she remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of
        a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather
        inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
        but it said nothing.</p>
        <p>“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I dare say it’s
        a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all
        her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
        anything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which
        was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a
        sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with
        fright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she
        had hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like
        cats.”</p>
        <p>“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would
        _you_ like cats if you were me?”</p>
        <p>“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry
        about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d
        take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear
        quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about
        in the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her
        paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to
        nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your
        pardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all
        over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk
        about her any more if you’d rather not.”</p>
        <p>“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
        tail. “As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always
        _hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name
        again!”</p>
        <p>“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
        conversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not
        answer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near
        our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
        know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when
        you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
        of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you
        know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says
        it kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,
        “I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away
        from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the
        pool as it went.</p>
        <p>So she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
        won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the
        Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face
        was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low
        trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my
        history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”</p>
        <p>It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
        birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a
        Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice
        led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.</p>

        <p>1. 'Queer' means strange or unusual. Example sentence: The new student in class had a queer accent that nobody could place.</p>
        <p>2. Alice saw something splashing about in the pool a little way off, which she initially thought was a walrus or hippopotamus. However, she soon realized it was only a mouse that had slipped into the pool like herself.</p>
        <p>3. Alice said, "Où est ma chatte?" to the mouse, which means "Where is my cat?" in French. She did this because she thought the mouse might be able to speak French since everything seemed strange and out-of-the-way in Wonderland.</p>
        <p>4. The mouse seemed to look at Alice inquisitively and seemed to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing. Alice thought that perhaps the mouse did not understand English or that it might be a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror. The mouse became frightened when Alice said the French sentence, which made her realize that the mouse did not like cats.</p>
        <p>5. At the end of the passage, Alice and the mouse swam to the shore, where they met a group of birds and animals that had also fallen into the pool, including a Duck, a Dodo, a Lory, an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures.</p>
        <p>6. Open question. </p>
        <p>7. The passage includes various language devices, such as dialogue, inner thoughts, and descriptive language. Alice's inner thoughts reveal her curiosity and willingness to try new things, while the dialogue between Alice and the mouse shows how their communication differs due to their different languages and backgrounds. Additionally, the descriptive language helps to create a vivid picture of the unusual and strange world of Wonderland.</p>
