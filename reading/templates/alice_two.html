    <p class="w3-large"><strong>CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
        <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
        bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
        the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
        conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice
        “without pictures or conversations?”</p>
        <p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
        hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
        making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
        picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
        close by her.</p>
        <p>There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
        so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh
        dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,
        it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
        time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a
        watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried
        on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
        had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
        watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
        field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
        large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>
        <p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
        in the world she was to get out again.</p>
        <p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
        dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
        about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very
        deep well.</p>
        <p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
        plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what
        was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out
        what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
        looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
        cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
        hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she
        passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great
        disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
        of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the
        cupboards as she fell past it.</p>
        <p>“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall
        think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me
        at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the
        top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)</p>
        <p>Down, down, down. Would the fall <i>never</i> come to an end? “I wonder how
        many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be
        getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would
        be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt
        several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and
        though this was not a <i>very</i> good opportunity for showing off her
        knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good
        practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but
        then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no
        idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice
        grand words to say.)</p>
        <p>Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right <i>through</i>
        the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk
        with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather
        glad there <i>was</i> no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all
        the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the
        country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”
        (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy <i>curtseying</i> as you’re
        falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what
        an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do
        to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”</p>

    <div class="w3-row-padding" id="answer_message1" style="display: none; margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
        <p>1. The story seems to be a fantasy or adventure story, with a young girl named Alice as the main character.</p>
        <p>2. There are several language devices used in the story, including personification (the White Rabbit saying to itself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!"), repetition (Alice wondering about the rabbit's waistcoat-pocket and watch), and hyperbole (Alice imagining falling off the top of a house).</p>
        <p>3. Alice followed the rabbit because she was curious about it, especially after seeing it take a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, which she found unusual.</p>
        <p>4. While she was going down in the rabbit hole, Alice thought about several things, including the depth of the hole, her location relative to the center of the earth, and the possibility of falling right through the earth and coming out in a different country.</p>
        <p>5. Longitude and latitude are geographic coordinates used to specify a location on the Earth's surface. Longitude refers to the east-west position, while latitude refers to the north-south position. Example sentence: The coordinates of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France are 48.8584° N, 2.2945° E, with "N" indicating its latitude north of the equator and "E" indicating its longitude east of the Prime Meridian.</p>
        <p>6. The answer can various. It's difficult to say whether Alice is a good student at school based on this excerpt alone, but it does suggest that she has learned some things in her lessons, even if she doesn't fully understand them (such as longitude and latitude). She also seems curious and imaginative, which could be qualities of a good student.</p>
