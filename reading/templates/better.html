        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Atul Gawande’s</strong> <em>Better: A Surgeon’s Notes on Performance</em> examines how individuals and systems in the medical field can improve their outcomes, efficiency, and humanity. Published in 2007, the book builds on Gawande’s earlier work, <em>Complications</em>, but shifts focus from the imperfections of medicine to the pursuit of excellence. Gawande reflects on the challenges of delivering high-quality care in a complex, resource-constrained environment, offering practical and ethical insights that transcend medicine.</p>
        <p>What sets this book apart is its exploration of performance improvement through a humanistic lens. Gawande combines personal anecdotes, global case studies, and thoughtful analysis to identify the habits and principles that enable medical professionals to strive for “better.” These lessons resonate not only with healthcare providers but with anyone seeking to improve their craft, making the book a guide for excellence in any field.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Summary</strong></p>
        <p><em>Better</em> is divided into five key sections: Diligence, Doing Right, and Ingenuity, along with an introduction and an afterword.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Gawande introduces the idea that better performance in medicine hinges on human effort, ingenuity, and ethics.</li>
            <li><strong>Diligence:</strong> This section explores the importance of thoroughness in tasks like infection control. Gawande highlights how simple measures, like proper handwashing, can drastically reduce patient mortality.</li>
            <li><strong>Doing Right:</strong> Gawande discusses the moral and ethical dilemmas healthcare providers face, such as the balance between care and harm in experimental treatments.</li>
            <li><strong>Ingenuity:</strong> He emphasizes creativity and innovation in overcoming resource constraints and delivering better outcomes, sharing global examples of ingenuity in medicine.</li>
            <li><strong>Afterword:</strong> Gawande provides a call to action, encouraging readers to aim for incremental improvements through reflection, persistence, and active engagement in their field.</li>
        </ul>
