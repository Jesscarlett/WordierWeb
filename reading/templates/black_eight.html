    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<p><br>
One morning, as Jerry had just put me into the shafts and was fastening<br>
the traces, a gentleman walked into the yard. "Your servant, sir,"
said<br>
Jerry.<br>
<br>
"Good-morning, Mr. Barker," said the gentleman. "I should be
glad to<br>
make some arrangements with you for taking Mrs. Briggs regularly to<br>
church on Sunday mornings. We go to the New Church now, and that is<br>
rather further than she can walk."<br>
<br>
"Thank you, sir," said Jerry, "but I have only taken out a
six-days'<br>
license,* and therefore I could not take a fare on a Sunday; it would<br>
not be legal."<br>
<br>
<br>
* A few years since the annual charge for a cab license was very much<br>
reduced, and the difference between the six and seven days' cabs was<br>
abolished.<br>
<br>
<br>
"Oh!" said the other, "I did not know yours was a six-days' cab;
but of<br>
course it would be very easy to alter your license. I would see that you<br>
did not lose by it; the fact is, Mrs. Briggs very much prefers you to<br>
drive her."<br>
<br>
"I should be glad to oblige the lady, sir, but I had a seven-days'<br>
license once, and the work was too hard for me, and too hard for my<br>
horses. Year in and year out, not a day's rest, and never a Sunday with<br>
my wife and children; and never able to go to a place of worship, which<br>
I had always been used to do before I took to the driving box. So for<br>
the last five years I have only taken a six-days' license, and I find it<br>
better all the way round."<br>
<br>
"Well, of course," replied Mr. Briggs, "it is very proper that
every<br>
person should have rest, and be able to go to church on Sundays, but I<br>
should have thought you would not have minded such a short distance for<br>
the horse, and only once a day; you would have all the afternoon and<br>
evening for yourself, and we are very good customers, you know."<br>
<br>
"Yes, sir, that is true, and I am grateful for all favors, I am sure;<br>
and anything that I could do to oblige you, or the lady, I should be<br>
proud and happy to do; but I can't give up my Sundays, sir, indeed I<br>
can't. I read that God made man, and he made horses and all the other<br>
beasts, and as soon as He had made them He made a day of rest, and bade<br>
that all should rest one day in seven; and I think, sir, He must have<br>
known what was good for them, and I am sure it is good for me; I am<br>
stronger and healthier altogether, now that I have a day of rest; the<br>
horses are fresh too, and do not wear up nearly so fast. The six-day<br>
drivers all tell me the same, and I have laid by more money in the<br>
savings bank than ever I did before; and as for the wife and children,<br>
sir, why, heart alive! they would not go back to the seven days for all<br>
they could see."<br>
<br>
"Oh, very well," said the gentleman. "Don't trouble yourself,
Mr.<br>
Barker, any further. I will inquire somewhere else," and he walked away.<br>
<br>
"Well," says Jerry to me, "we can't help it, Jack, old boy; we
must have<br>
our Sundays."<br>
<br>
"Polly!" he shouted, "Polly! come here."<br>
<br>
She was there in a minute.<br>
<br>
"What is it all about, Jerry?"<br>
<br>
"Why, my dear, Mr. Briggs wants me to take Mrs. Briggs to church every<br>
Sunday morning. I say I have only a six-days' license. He says, 'Get a<br>
seven-days' license, and I'll make it worth your while;' and you know,<br>
Polly, they are very good customers to us. Mrs. Briggs often goes out<br>
shopping for hours, or making calls, and then she pays down fair and<br>
honorable like a lady; there's no beating down or making three hours<br>
into two hours and a half, as some folks do; and it is easy work for<br>
the horses; not like tearing along to catch trains for people that are<br>
always a quarter of an hour too late; and if I don't oblige her in this<br>
matter it is very likely we shall lose them altogether. What do you say,<br>
little woman?"<br>
<br>
"I say, Jerry," says she, speaking very slowly, "I say, if Mrs.
Briggs<br>
would give you a sovereign every Sunday morning, I would not have you a<br>
seven-days' cabman again. We have known what it was to have no Sundays,<br>
and now we know what it is to call them our own. Thank God, you earn<br>
enough to keep us, though it is sometimes close work to pay for all the<br>
oats and hay, the license, and the rent besides; but Harry will soon be<br>
earning something, and I would rather struggle on harder than we do than<br>
go back to those horrid times when you hardly had a minute to look at<br>
your own children, and we never could go to a place of worship together,<br>
or have a happy, quiet day. God forbid that we should ever turn back to<br>
those times; that's what I say, Jerry."<br>
<br>
"And that is just what I told Mr. Briggs, my dear," said Jerry,
"and<br>
what I mean to stick to. So don't go and fret yourself, Polly" (for she<br>
had begun to cry); "I would not go back to the old times if I earned<br>
twice as much, so that is settled, little woman. Now, cheer up, and I'll<br>
be off to the stand."<br>
<br>
Three weeks had passed away after this conversation, and no order had<br>
come from Mrs. Briggs; <span class="GramE">so</span> there was nothing but taking
jobs from the<br>
stand. Jerry took it to heart a good deal, for of course the work was<br>
harder for horse and man. But Polly would always cheer him up, and say,<br>
"Never mind, father, never, mind.<br>
<br>
<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"'Do your best,<br>
<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And leave the rest,<br>
<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>'Twill all come right<br>
<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some day or night.'"<br>
<br>
It soon became known that Jerry had lost his best customer, and for what<br>
reason. Most of the men said he was a fool, but two or three took his<br>
part.<br>
<br>
"If workingmen don't stick to their Sunday," said Truman,
"they'll soon<br>
have none left; it is every man's right and every beast's right. By<br>
God's law we have a day of rest, and by the law of England we have a day<br>
of rest; and I say we ought to hold to the rights these laws give us and<br>
keep them for our children."<br>
<br>
"All very well for you religious chaps to talk so," said Larry;
"but<br>
I'll turn a shilling when I can. I don't believe in religion, for I<br>
don't see that your religious people are any better than the rest."<br>
<br>
"If they are not better," put in Jerry, "it is because they are
not<br>
religious. You might as well say that our country's laws are not good<br>
because some people break them. If a man gives way to his temper, and<br>
speaks evil of his neighbor, and does not pay his debts, he is not<br>
religious, I don't care how much he goes to church. If some men are<br>
shams and humbugs, that does not make religion untrue. Real religion is<br>
the best and truest thing in the world, and the only thing that can make<br>
a man really happy or make the world we live in any better."<br>
<br>
"If religion was good for anything," said Jones, "it would
prevent your<br>
religious people from making us work on Sundays, as you know many of<br>
them do, and that's why I say religion is nothing but a sham; why, if it<br>
was not for the church and chapel-goers it would be hardly worth while<br>
our coming out on a Sunday. But they have their privileges, as they call<br>
them, and I go without. I shall expect them to answer for my soul, if I<br>
can't get a chance of saving it."<br>
<br>
Several of the men applauded this, till Jerry said:<br>
<br>
"That may sound well enough, but it won't do; every man must look<br>
after his own soul; you can't lay it down at another man's door like a<br>
foundling and expect him to take care of it; and don't you see, if you<br>
are always sitting on your box waiting for a fare, they will say, 'If we<br>
don't take him some one else will, and he does not look for any Sunday.'<br>
Of course, they don't go to the bottom of it, or they would see if they<br>
never came for a cab it would be no use your standing there; but<br>
people don't always like to go to the bottom of things; it may not be<br>
convenient to do it; but if you Sunday drivers would all strike for a<br>
day of rest the thing would be done."<br>
<br>
"And what would all the good people do if they could not get to their<br>
favorite preachers?" said Larry.<br>
<br>
"'Tis not for me to lay down plans for other people," said Jerry,
"but<br>
if they can't walk so far they can go to what is nearer; and if it<br>
should rain they can put on their mackintoshes as they do on a week-day.<br>
If a thing is right it can be done, and if it is wrong it can be done<br>
without; and a good man will find a way. And that is as true for us<br>
cabmen as it is for the <span class="GramE">church-goers</span>."<br>

        <p>1. Jerry refuses to take a fare on Sundays because he values the day of rest. He mentions that he had a seven-days' license before, and the constant work without a break on Sundays was hard on both him and his horses. He believes in the importance of having a day of rest, as he mentions that it is good for his health, the horses' well-being, and his family life.</p>
        <p>2. Polly supports Jerry's decision to stick to a six-days' license and not work on Sundays. She emphasizes the importance of having Sundays as a day of rest, highlighting the positive impact it has on their family life. She expresses gratitude for the time they can spend together on Sundays and emphasizes that she would rather struggle financially than go back to the difficult times when Jerry had no time for his family or a day of rest.</p>

     <p><br>
Two or three weeks after this, as we came into the yard rather late in<br>
the evening, Polly came running across the road with the lantern (she<br>
always brought it to him if it was not very wet).<br>
<br>
"It has all come right, Jerry; Mrs. Briggs sent her servant this<br>
afternoon to ask you to take her out to-morrow at eleven o'clock. I<br>
said, 'Yes, I thought so, but we supposed she employed some one else<br>
now.'"<br>
<br>
"'Well,' said he, 'the real fact is, master was put out because Mr.<br>
Barker refused to come on Sundays, and he has been trying other cabs,<br>
but there's something wrong with them all; some drive too fast, and some<br>
too slow, and the mistress says there is not one of them so nice and<br>
clean as yours, and nothing will suit her but Mr. Barker's cab again.'"<br>
<br>
Polly was almost out of breath, and Jerry broke out into a merry laugh.<br>
<br>
"''Twill all come right some day or night': you were right, my dear; you<br>
generally are. Run in and get the supper, and I'll have Jack's harness<br>
off and make him snug and happy in no time."<br>
<br>
After this Mrs. Briggs wanted Jerry's cab quite as often as before,<br>
never, however, on a Sunday; but there came a day when we had Sunday<br>
work, and this was how it happened. We had all come home on the Saturday<br>
night very tired, and very glad to think that the next day would be all<br>
rest, but so it was not to be.<br>
<br>
On Sunday morning Jerry was cleaning me in the yard, when Polly stepped<br>
up to him, looking very full of something.<br>
<br>
"What is it?" said Jerry.<br>
<br>
"Well, my dear," she said, "poor Dinah Brown has just had a
letter<br>
brought to say that her mother is dangerously ill, and that she must<br>
go directly if she wishes to see her alive. The place is more than ten<br>
miles away from here, out in the country, and she says if she takes the<br>
train she should still have four miles to walk; and so weak as she is,<br>
and the baby only four weeks old, of course that would be impossible;<br>
and she wants to know if you would take her in your cab, and she<br>
promises to pay you faithfully, as she can get the money."<br>
<br>
"Tut, tut! we'll see about that. It was not the money I was thinking<br>
about, but of losing our Sunday; the horses are tired, and I am tired,<br>
too--that's where it pinches."<br>
<br>
"It pinches all round, for that matter," said Polly, "for it's
only<br>
half Sunday without you, but you know we should do to other people as<br>
we should like they should do to us; and I know very well what I should<br>
like if my mother was dying; and Jerry, dear, I am sure it won't break<br>
the Sabbath; for if pulling a poor beast or donkey out of a pit would<br>
not spoil it, I am quite sure taking poor Dinah would not do it."<br>
<br>
"Why, Polly, you are as good as the minister, and so, as I've had my<br>
Sunday-morning sermon early to-day, you may go and tell Dinah that I'll<br>
be ready for her as the clock strikes ten; but stop--just step round to<br>
butcher Braydon's with my compliments, and ask him if he would lend me<br>
his light trap; I know he never uses it on the Sunday, and it would make<br>
a wonderful difference to the horse."<br>
<br>
Away she went, and soon returned, saying that he could have the trap and<br>
welcome.<br>
<br>
"All right," said he; "now put me up a bit of bread and cheese,
and I'll<br>
be back in the afternoon as soon as I can."<br>
<br>
"And I'll have the meat pie ready for an early tea instead of for<br>
dinner," said Polly; and away she went, while he made his preparations<br>
to the tune of "Polly's the woman and no mistake", of which tune he
was<br>
very fond.<br>
<br>
I was selected for the journey, and at ten o'clock we started, in a<br>
light, high-wheeled gig, which ran so easily that after the four-wheeled<br>
cab it seemed like nothing.<br>
<br>
It was a fine May day, and as soon as we were out of the town, the sweet<br>
air, the smell of the fresh grass, and the soft country roads were as<br>
pleasant as they used to be in the old times, and I soon began to feel<br>
quite fresh.<br>
<br>
Dinah's family lived in a small farmhouse, up a green lane, close by a<br>
meadow with some fine shady trees; there were two cows feeding in it.<br>
A young man asked Jerry to bring his trap into the meadow, and he would<br>
tie me up in the cowshed; he wished he had a better stable to offer.<br>
<br>
"If your cows would not be offended," said Jerry, "there is
nothing my<br>
horse would like so well as to have an hour or two in your beautiful<br>
meadow; he's quiet, and it would be a rare treat for him."<br>
<br>
"Do, and welcome," said the young man; "the best we have is at
your<br>
service for your kindness to my sister; we shall be having some dinner<br>
in an hour, and I hope you'll come in, though with mother so ill we are<br>
all out of sorts in the house."<br>
<br>
Jerry thanked him kindly, but said as he had some dinner with him there<br>
was nothing he should like so well as walking about in the meadow.<br>
<br>
When my harness was taken off I did not know what I should do<br>
first--whether to eat the grass, or roll over on my back, or lie down<br>
and rest, or have a gallop across the meadow out of sheer spirits at<br>
being free; and I did all by turns. Jerry seemed to be quite as happy<br>
as I was; he sat down by a bank under a shady tree, and listened to the<br>
birds, then he sang himself, and read out of the little brown book he is<br>
so fond of, then wandered round the meadow, and down by a little brook,<br>
where he picked the flowers and the hawthorn, and tied them up with<br>
long sprays of ivy; then he gave me a good feed of the oats which he had<br>
brought with him; but the time seemed all too short--I had not been in a<br>
field since I left poor Ginger at Earlshall.<br>
<br>
We came home gently, and Jerry's first words were, as we came into the<br>
yard, "Well, Polly, I have not lost my Sunday after all, for the birds<br>
were singing hymns in every bush, and I joined in the service; and as<br>
for Jack, he was like a young colt."<br>
<br>
When he handed Dolly the flowers she jumped about for joy.<br>

        <p>2. Polly convinces Jerry to take Dinah by appealing to his sense of compassion and the golden rule. She mentions that if her mother were dying, she would appreciate someone's help, and she believes in treating others as they would like to be treated. Polly's empathy and persuasive words encourage Jerry to agree to help Dinah, putting aside his initial concerns about losing their Sunday.</p>

<p><br>
Winter came in early, with a great deal of cold and wet. There was snow,<br>
or sleet, or rain almost every day for weeks, changing only for keen<br>
driving winds or sharp frosts. The horses all felt it very much. When<br>
it is a dry cold a couple of good thick rugs will keep the warmth in us;<br>
but when it is soaking rain they soon get wet through and are no good.<br>
Some of the drivers had a waterproof cover to throw over, which was a<br>
fine thing; but some of the men were so poor that they could not protect<br>
either themselves or their horses, and many of them suffered very much<br>
that winter. When we horses had worked half the day we went to our dry<br>
stables, and could rest, while they had to sit on their boxes, sometimes<br>
staying out as late as one or two o'clock in the morning if they had a<br>
party to wait for.<br>
<br>
When the streets were slippery with frost or snow that was the worst of<br>
all for us horses. One mile of such traveling, with a weight to draw<br>
and no firm footing, would take more out of us than four on a good<br>
road; every nerve and muscle of our bodies is on the strain to keep our<br>
balance; and, added to this, the fear of falling is more exhausting than<br>
anything else. If the roads are very bad indeed our shoes are roughed,<br>
but that makes us feel nervous at first.<br>
<br>
When the weather was very bad many of the men would go and sit in the<br>
tavern close by, and get some one to watch for them; but they often<br>
lost a fare in that way, and could not, as Jerry said, be there without<br>
spending money. He never went to the Rising Sun; there was a coffee-shop<br>
near, where he now and then went, or he bought of an old man, who came<br>
to our rank with tins of hot coffee and pies. It was his opinion that<br>
spirits and beer made a man colder afterward, and that dry clothes, good<br>
food, cheerfulness, and a comfortable wife at home, were the best things<br>
to keep a cabman warm. Polly always supplied him with something to eat<br>
when he could not get home, and sometimes he would see little Dolly<br>
peeping from the corner of the street, to make sure if "father" was
on<br>
the stand. If she saw <span class="GramE">him</span> she would run off at full
speed and soon come<br>
back with something in a tin or basket, some hot soup or pudding Polly<br>
had ready. It was wonderful how such a little thing could get safely<br>
across the street, often thronged with horses and carriages; but she was<br>
a brave little <span class="GramE">maid, and</span> felt it quite an honor to
bring "father's first<br>
course", as he used to call it. She was a general favorite on the stand,<br>
and there was not a man who would not have seen her safely across the<br>
street, if Jerry had not been able to do it.<br>
<br>
One cold windy day Dolly had brought Jerry a basin of something hot,<br>
and was standing by him while he ate it. He had scarcely begun when<br>
a gentleman, walking toward us very fast, held up his umbrella. Jerry<br>
touched his hat in return, gave the basin to Dolly, and was taking off<br>
my cloth, when the gentleman, hastening up, cried out, "No, no, finish<br>
your soup, my friend; I have not much time to spare, but I can wait<br>
till you have done, and set your little girl safe on the pavement." So<br>
saying, he seated himself in the cab. Jerry thanked him <span class="GramE">kindly,
and</span> came<br>
back to Dolly.<br>
<br>
"There, Dolly, that's a gentleman; that's a real gentleman, Dolly; he<br>
has got time and thought for the comfort of a poor cabman and a little<br>
girl."<br>
<br>
Jerry finished his soup, set the child across, and then took his orders<br>
to drive to Clapham Rise. Several times after that the same gentleman<br>
took our cab. I think he was very fond of dogs and horses, for whenever<br>
we took him to his own door two or three dogs would come bounding out<br>
to meet him. Sometimes he came round and patted me, saying in his quiet,<br>
pleasant way, "This horse has got a good master, and he deserves it."<br>
It was a very rare thing for any one to notice the horse that had been<br>
working for him. I have known ladies to do it now and then, and this<br>
gentleman, and one or two others have given me a pat and a kind word;<br>
but ninety-nine persons out of a hundred would as soon think of patting<br>
the steam engine that drew the train.<br>
<br>
The gentleman was not young, and there was a forward stoop in his<br>
shoulders as if he was always going at something. His lips were thin and<br>
close shut, though they had a very pleasant smile; his eye was keen, and<br>
there was something in his jaw and the motion of his head that made one<br>
think he was very determined in anything he set about. His voice was<br>
pleasant and kind; any horse would trust that voice, though it was just<br>
as decided as everything else about him.<br>
<br>
One day he and another gentleman took our cab; they stopped at a shop<br>
in R---- Street, and while his friend went <span class="GramE">in</span> he stood
at the door. A<br>
little ahead of us on the other side of the street a cart with two very<br>
fine horses was standing before some wine vaults; the carter was not<br>
with them, and I cannot tell how long they had been standing, but they<br>
seemed to think they had waited long enough, and began to move off.<br>
Before they had gone many paces the carter came running out and caught<br>
them. He seemed furious at their having moved, and with whip and rein<br>
punished them brutally, even beating them about the head. Our gentleman<br>
saw it all, and stepping quickly across the street, said in a decided<br>
voice:<br>
<br>
"If you don't stop that directly, I'll have you arrested for leaving<br>
your horses, and for brutal conduct."<br>
<br>
The man, who had clearly been drinking, poured forth some abusive<br>
language, but he left off knocking the horses about, and taking the<br>
reins, got into his cart; meantime our friend had quietly taken a<br>
note-book from his pocket, and looking at the name and address painted<br>
on the cart, he wrote something down.<br>
<br>
"What do you want with that?" growled the carter, as he cracked his
whip<br>
and was moving on. A nod and a grim smile was the only answer he got.<br>
<br>
On returning to the cab our friend was joined by his companion, who said<br>
laughingly, "I should have thought, Wright, you had enough business of<br>
your own to look after, without troubling yourself about other people's<br>
horses and servants."<br>
<br>
Our friend stood still for a moment, and throwing his head a little<br>
back, "Do you know why this world is as bad as it is?"<br>
<br>
"No," said the other.<br>
<br>
"Then I'll tell you. It is because people think only about their own<br>
<span class="GramE">business, and</span> won't trouble themselves to stand up for
the oppressed,<br>
nor bring the wrongdoer to light. I never see a wicked thing like this<br>
without doing what I can, and many a master has thanked me for letting<br>
him know how his horses have been used."<br>
<br>
"I wish there were more gentlemen like you, sir," said Jerry,
"for they<br>
are wanted badly enough in this city."<br>
<br>
After this we continued our journey, and as they got out of the cab our<br>
friend was saying, "My doctrine is this, that if we see cruelty or<br>
wrong that we have the power to stop, and do nothing, we make ourselves<br>
sharers in the guilt."<br>

        <p>1. The winter weather brought cold, wet conditions, including snow, sleet, rain, driving winds, and sharp frosts. The horses found it challenging, especially in slippery conditions, and the drivers, many of whom were poor, suffered because they often lacked proper protection for themselves and their horses.</p>
        <p>2. The gentleman stopped the carter from mistreating his horses because he witnessed the brutality and found it unacceptable. He threatened to have the carter arrested for leaving his horses and engaging in brutal conduct. The gentleman also took note of the carter's name and address, indicating that he intended to take further action against the wrongdoer. </p>

39 Seedy Sam<br>
<br>
<br>
I should say that for a cab-horse I was very well off indeed; my driver<br>
was my owner, and it was his interest to treat me well and not overwork<br>
me, even had he not been so good a man as he was; but there were a great<br>
many horses which belonged to the large cab-owners, who let them out to<br>
their drivers for so much money a day. As the horses did not belong to<br>
these men the only thing they thought of was how to get their money out<br>
of them, first, to pay the master, and then to provide for their own<br>
living; and a dreadful time some of these horses had of it. Of course,<br>
I understood but little, but it was often talked over on the stand,<br>
and the governor, who was a kind-hearted man and fond of horses, would<br>
sometimes speak up if one came in very much jaded or ill-used.<br>
<br>
One day a shabby, miserable-looking driver, who went by the name of<br>
"Seedy Sam", brought in his horse looking dreadfully beat, and the<br>
governor said:<br>
<br>
"You and your horse look more fit for the police station than for this<br>
rank."<br>
<br>
The man flung his tattered rug over the horse, turned full round upon<br>
the Governor and said in a voice that sounded almost desperate:<br>
<br>
"If the police have any business with the matter it ought to be with the<br>
masters who charge us so much, or with the fares that are fixed so low.<br>
If a man has to pay eighteen shillings a day for the use of a cab and<br>
two horses, as many of us have to do in the season, and must make that<br>
up before we earn a penny for ourselves I say 'tis more than hard work;<br>
nine shillings a day to get out of each horse before you begin to get<br>
your own living. You know that's true, and if the horses don't work we<br>
must starve, and I and my children have known what that is before now.<br>
I've six of 'em, and only one earns anything; I am on the stand fourteen<br>
or sixteen hours a day, and I haven't had a Sunday these ten or twelve<br>
weeks; you know Skinner never gives a day if he can help it, and if I<br>
don't work hard, tell me who does! I want a warm coat and a mackintosh,<br>
but with so many to feed how can a man get it? I had to pledge my clock<br>
a week ago to pay Skinner, and I shall never see it again."<br>
<br>
Some of the other drivers stood round nodding their heads and saying he<br>
was right. The man went on:<br>
<br>
"You that have your own horses and cabs, or drive for good masters, have<br>
a chance of getting on and a chance of doing right; I haven't. We can't<br>
charge more than sixpence a mile after the first, within the four-mile<br>
radius. This very <span class="GramE">morning</span> I had to go a clear six
miles and only took<br>
three shillings. I could not get a return fare, and had to come all the<br>
way back; there's twelve miles for the horse and three shillings for me.<br>
After that I had a three-mile fare, and there were bags and boxes enough<br>
to have brought in a good many twopences if they had been put outside;<br>
but you know how people do; all that could be piled up inside on the<br>
front seat were put in and three heavy boxes went on the top. That<br>
was sixpence, and the fare one and sixpence; then I got a return for a<br>
shilling. Now that makes eighteen miles for the horse and six shillings<br>
for me; there's three shillings still for that horse to earn and nine<br>
shillings for the afternoon horse before I touch a penny. Of course, it<br>
is not always so bad as that, but you know it often is, and I say 'tis<br>
a mockery to tell a man that he must not overwork his horse, for when a<br>
beast is downright tired there's nothing but the whip that will keep<br>
his legs a-going; you can't help yourself--you must put your wife and<br>
children before the horse; the masters must look to that, we can't. I<br>
don't ill-use my horse for the sake of it; none of you can say I do.<br>
There's wrong lays somewhere--never a day's rest, never a quiet hour<br>
with the wife and children. I often feel like an old man, though I'm<br>
only forty-five. You know how quick some of the <span class="GramE">gentry</span>
are to suspect us<br>
of cheating and overcharging; why, they stand with their purses in<br>
their hands counting it over to a penny and looking at us as if we were<br>
pickpockets. I wish some of 'em had got to sit on my box sixteen hours<br>
a day and get a living out of it and eighteen shillings <span class="GramE">beside,</span>
and that<br>
in all weathers; they would not be so uncommon particular never to give<br>
us a sixpence over or to cram all the luggage inside. Of course, some of<br>
'em tip us pretty handsome now and then, or else we could not live; but<br>
you can't depend upon that."<br>
<br>
The men who stood round much approved this speech, and one of them said,<br>
"It is desperate hard, and if a man sometimes does what is wrong it is<br>
no wonder, and if he gets a dram too much who's to blow him up?"<br>
<br>
Jerry had taken no part in this conversation, but I never saw his face<br>
look so sad before. The governor had stood with both his hands in his<br>
pockets; now he took his handkerchief out of his hat and wiped his<br>
forehead.<br>
<br>
"You've beaten me, Sam," he said, "for it's all true, and I
won't cast<br>
it up to you any more about the police; it was the look in that horse's<br>
eye that came over me. It is hard lines for man and it is hard lines for<br>
beast, and who's to mend it I don't know: but anyway you might tell<br>
the poor beast that you were sorry to take it out of him in that way.<br>
Sometimes a kind word is all we can give 'em, poor brutes, and 'tis<br>
wonderful what they do understand."<br>
<br>
A few mornings after this talk a new man came on the stand with Sam's<br>
cab.<br>
<br>
"Halloo!" said one, "what's up with Seedy Sam?"<br>
<br>
"He's ill in bed," said the man; "he was taken last night in the
yard,<br>
and could scarcely crawl home. His wife sent a boy this morning to<br>
say his father was in a high fever and could not get out, so I'm here<br>
instead."<br>
<br>
The next morning the same man came again.<br>
<br>
"How is Sam?" inquired the governor.<br>
<br>
"He's gone," said the man.<br>
<br>
"What, gone? You don't mean to say he's dead?"<br>
<br>
"Just snuffed out," said the other; "he died at four o'clock
this<br>
morning; all yesterday he was raving--raving about <span class="GramE">Skinner,
and</span> having<br>
no Sundays. 'I never had a Sunday's rest,' these were his last words."<br>
<br>
No one spoke for a while, and then the governor said, "I'll tell you<br>
what, mates, this is a warning for us."<br>
<br>

        <p>1. "Seedy Sam" brought his horse to the governor because the horse looked beat and mistreated.

        <p>2. "Seedy Sam" fell ill and died. The news saddened the governor and the other men on the stand. The governor expressed his acknowledgment of the hardships faced by cab drivers and recognized that Sam's death was a warning for everyone.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Chapter 40. Poor Ginger</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<p><br>
One day, while our cab and many others were waiting outside one of the<br>
parks where music was playing, a shabby old cab drove up beside ours.<br>
The horse was an old worn-out chestnut, with an ill-kept coat, and<br>
bones that showed plainly through it, the knees knuckled over, and the<br>
<span class="GramE">fore-legs</span> were very unsteady. I had been eating some
hay, and the wind<br>
rolled a little lock of it that way, and the poor creature put out her<br>
long thin neck and picked it up, and then turned and looked about for<br>
more. There was a hopeless look in the dull eye that I could not help<br>
noticing, and then, as I was thinking where I had seen that horse<br>
before, she looked full at me and said, "Black Beauty, is that you?"<br>
<br>
It was Ginger! but how changed! The beautifully arched and glossy neck<br>
was now straight, and lank, and fallen in; the clean straight legs and<br>
delicate fetlocks were swelled; the joints were grown out of shape with<br>
hard work; the face, that was once so full of spirit and life, was now<br>
full of suffering, and I could tell by the heaving of her sides, and her<br>
frequent cough, how bad her breath was.<br>
<br>
Our drivers were standing together a little way off, so I sidled up to<br>
her a step or two, that we might have a little quiet talk. It was a sad<br>
tale that she had to tell.<br>
<br>
After a twelvemonth's run off at Earlshall, she was considered to be fit<br>
for work <span class="GramE">again, and</span> was sold to a gentleman. For a
little while she<br>
got on very well, but after a longer gallop than usual the old strain<br>
returned, and after being rested and doctored she was again sold. In<br>
this way she changed hands several times, but always getting lower down.<br>
<br>
"And so at last," said she, "I was bought by a man who keeps a
number of<br>
cabs and <span class="GramE">horses, and</span> lets them out. You look well off,
and I am glad of<br>
it, but I could not tell you what my life has been. When they found out<br>
my weakness they said I was not worth what they gave for me, and that I<br>
must go into one of the low cabs, and just be used up; that is what<br>
they are doing, whipping and working with never one thought of what I<br>
suffer--they paid for me, and must get it out of me, they say. The man<br>
who hires me now pays a deal of money to the owner every day, and so he<br>
has to get it out of me too; and so it's all the week round and round,<br>
with never a Sunday rest."<br>
<br>
I said, "You used to stand up for yourself if you were ill-used."<br>
<br>
"Ah!" she said, "I did once, but it's no use; men are strongest,
and if<br>
they are cruel and have no feeling, there is nothing that we can do, but<br>
just bear it--bear it on and on to the end. I wish the end was come,<br>
I wish I was dead. I have seen dead horses, and I am sure they do not<br>
suffer pain; I wish I may drop down dead at my work, and not be sent off<br>
to the knackers."<br>
<br>
I was very much troubled, and I put my nose up to hers, but I could say<br>
nothing to comfort her. I think she was pleased to see me, for she said,<br>
"You are the only friend I ever had."<br>
<br>
Just then her driver came up, and with a tug at her mouth backed her out<br>
of the line and drove off, leaving me very sad indeed.<br>
<br>
A short time after this a cart with a dead horse in it passed our<br>
cab-stand. The head hung out of the cart-tail, the lifeless tongue was<br>
slowly dropping with blood; and the sunken eyes! but I can't speak of<br>
them, the sight was too dreadful. It was a chestnut horse with a long,<br>
thin neck. I saw a white streak down the forehead. I believe it was<br>
Ginger; I hoped it was, for then her troubles would be over. Oh! if men<br>
were more merciful they would shoot us before we came to such misery.<br>
