<br>
Now I had lived in this happy place three years, but sad changes were<br>
about to come over us. We heard from time to time that our mistress was<br>
ill. The doctor was often at the house, and the master looked grave and<br>
anxious. Then we heard that she must leave her home at <span class="GramE">once,
and</span> go to<br>
a warm country for two or three years. The news fell upon the household<br>
like the tolling of a deathbell. Everybody was sorry; but the master<br>
began directly to <span class="GramE">make arrangements</span> for breaking up
his establishment<br>
and leaving England. We used to hear it talked about in our stable;<br>
indeed, nothing else was talked about.<br>
<br>
John went about his work silent and sad, and Joe scarcely whistled.<br>
There was a great deal of coming and going; Ginger and I had full work.<br>
<br>
The first of the party who went were Miss Jessie and Flora, with their<br>
governess. They came to bid us good-by. They hugged poor Merrylegs<br>
like an old friend, and so indeed he was. Then we heard what had been<br>
arranged for us. Master had sold Ginger and me to his old friend,<br>
the Earl of W----, for he thought we should have a good place there.<br>
Merrylegs he had given to the vicar, who was wanting a pony for Mrs.<br>
Blomefield, but it was on the condition that he should never be sold,<br>
and that when he was past work he should be shot and buried.<br>
<br>
Joe was engaged to take care of him and to help in the house, so I<br>
thought that Merrylegs was well off. John had the offer of several good<br>
places, but he said he should wait a little and look round.<br>
<br>
The evening before they left the master came into the stable to give<br>
some directions, and to give his horses the last pat. He seemed very<br>
low-spirited; I knew that by his voice. I believe we horses can tell<br>
more by the voice than many men can.<br>
<br>
"Have you decided what to do, John?" he said. "I find you have
not<br>
accepted either of those offers."<br>
<br>
"No, sir; I have made up my mind that if I could get a situation with<br>
some first-rate colt-breaker and horse-trainer, it would be the right<br>
thing for me. Many young animals are frightened and spoiled by wrong<br>
treatment, which need not be if the right man took them in hand. I<br>
always get on well with horses, and if I could help some of them to a<br>
fair start I should feel as if I was doing some good. What do you think<br>
of it, sir?"<br>
<br>
"I don't know a man anywhere," said master, "that I should think
so<br>
suitable for it as yourself. You understand horses, and <span class="GramE">somehow</span>
they<br>
understand you, and in time you might set up for yourself; I think you<br>
could not do better. If in any way I can help you, write to me. I shall<br>
speak to my agent in <span class="GramE">London, and</span> leave your character
with him."<br>
<br>
Master gave John the name and address, and then he thanked him for his<br>
long and faithful service; but that was too much for John. "Pray, don't,<br>
sir, I can't bear it; you and my dear mistress have done so much for<br>
me that I could never repay it. But we shall never forget you, sir, and<br>
please God, we may some day see mistress back again like herself; we<br>
must keep up hope, sir." Master gave John his hand, but he did not<br>
speak, and they both left the stable.<br>
<br>
The last sad day had come; the footman and the heavy luggage had gone<br>
off the day before, and there were only master and mistress and her<br>
maid. Ginger and I brought the carriage up to the hall door for the last<br>
time. The servants brought out cushions and rugs and many other things;<br>
and when all were arranged master came down the steps carrying the<br>
mistress in his arms (I was on the side next to the house, and could see<br>
all that went on); he placed her carefully in the carriage, while the<br>
house servants stood round crying.<br>
<br>
"Good-by, again," he said; "we shall not forget any of
you," and he got<br>
in. "Drive on, John."<br>
<br>
Joe jumped up, and we trotted slowly through the park and through the<br>
village, where the people were standing at their doors to have a last<br>
look and to say, "God bless them."<br>
<br>
When we reached the railway <span class="GramE">station</span> I think mistress
walked from the<br>
carriage to the waiting-room. I heard her say in her own sweet voice,<br>
"Good-by, John. God bless you." I felt the rein twitch, but John made
no<br>
answer; perhaps he could not speak. As soon as Joe had taken the things<br>
out of the carriage John called him to stand by the horses, while he<br>
went on the platform. Poor Joe! he stood <span class="GramE">close up</span> to
our heads to hide<br>
his tears. Very soon the train came puffing up into the station; then<br>
two or three minutes, and the doors were slammed to, the guard whistled,<br>
and the train glided away, leaving behind it only clouds of white smoke<br>
and some very heavy hearts.<br>
<br>
When it was quite out of sight John came back.<br>
<br>
"We shall never see her again," he said--"never." He took
the reins,<br>
mounted the box, and with Joe drove slowly home; but it was not our home<br>
now.<br>

The news of her departure saddened everyone in the household, and there were arrangements to break up the establishment.

    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
      <p><br>
The next morning after breakfast Joe put Merrylegs into the mistress'<br>
low chaise to take him to the vicarage; he came first and said good-by<br>
to us, and Merrylegs neighed to us from the yard. Then John put the<br>
saddle on Ginger and the leading rein on <span class="GramE">me, and</span> rode
us across the<br>
country about fifteen miles to Earlshall Park, where the Earl of W----<br>
lived. There was a very fine house and a great deal of stabling. We went<br>
into the yard through a stone gateway, and John asked for Mr. York. It<br>
was some time before he came. He was a fine-looking, middle-aged man,<br>
and his voice said at once that he expected to be obeyed. He was very<br>
friendly and polite to John, and after giving us a slight look he<br>
called a groom to take us to our boxes, and invited John to take some<br>
refreshment.<br>
<br>
We were taken to a light, airy stable, and placed in boxes adjoining<br>
each other, where we were rubbed down and fed. In about half an hour<br>
John and Mr. York, who was to be our new coachman, came in to see us.<br>
<br>
"Now, Mr. Manly," he said, after carefully looking at us both,
"I can<br>
see no fault in these horses; but we all know that horses have their<br>
peculiarities as well as men, and that sometimes they need different<br>
treatment. I should like to know if there is anything particular in<br>
either of these that you would like to mention."<br>
<br>
"Well," said John, "I don't believe there is a better pair of
horses in<br>
the country, and right grieved I am to part with them, but they are not<br>
alike. The black one is the most perfect temper I ever knew; I suppose<br>
he has never known a hard <span class="GramE">word</span> or a blow since he was
foaled, and all<br>
his pleasure seems to be to do what you wish; but the chestnut, I fancy,<br>
must have had bad treatment; we heard as much from the dealer. She came<br>
to us snappish and suspicious, but when she found what sort of place<br>
ours was, it all went off by degrees; for three years I have never seen<br>
the smallest sign of temper, and if she is well treated there is not<br>
a better, more willing animal than she is. But she is naturally a more<br>
irritable constitution than the black horse; flies tease her more;<br>
anything wrong in the harness frets her more; and if she were ill-used<br>
or unfairly treated she would not be unlikely to give tit for tat. You<br>
know that many high-mettled horses will do so."<br>
<br>
"Of course," said York, "I quite understand; but you know it is
not easy<br>
in stables like these to have all the grooms just what they should be. I<br>
do my best, and there I must leave it. I'll remember what you have said<br>
about the mare."<br>
<br>
They were going out of the stable, when John stopped and said, "I had<br>
better mention that we have never used the check-rein with either of<br>
them; the black horse never had one on, and the dealer said it was the<br>
gag-bit that spoiled the other's temper."<br>
<br>
"Well," said York, "if they come here they must wear the
check-rein. I<br>
prefer a loose rein myself, and his lordship is always very reasonable<br>
about horses; but my lady--that's another thing; she will have style,<br>
and if her carriage horses are not reined up <span class="GramE">tight</span> she
wouldn't look at<br>
them. I always stand out against the gag-bit, and shall do so, but it<br>
must be tight up when my lady rides!"<br>
<br>
"I am sorry for it, very sorry," said John; "but I must go now,
or I<br>
shall lose the train."<br>
<br>
He came round to each of us to pat and speak to us for the last time;<br>
his voice sounded very sad.<br>
<br>
I held my face close to him; that was all I could do to say good-by; and<br>
then he was gone, and I have never seen him since.<br>
<br>
The next day Lord W---- came to look at us; he seemed pleased with our<br>
appearance.<br>
<br>
"I have great confidence in these horses," he said, "from the
character<br>
my friend Mr. Gordon has given me of them. <span class="GramE">Of course</span>
they are not a<br>
match in color, but my idea is that they will do very well for the<br>
carriage while we are in the country. Before we go to London I must try<br>
to match Baron; the black horse, I believe, is perfect for riding."<br>
<br>
York then told him what John had said about us.<br>
<br>
"Well," said he, "you must keep an eye to the mare, and put the<br>
check-rein easy; I dare say they will do very well with a little<br>
humoring at first. I'll mention it to your lady."<br>
<br>
In the afternoon we were harnessed and put in the carriage, and as the<br>
stable clock struck three we were led round to the front of the house.<br>
It was all very grand, and three or four times as large as the old house<br>
at Birtwick, but not half so pleasant, if a horse may have an opinion.<br>
Two footmen were standing ready, dressed in drab livery, with scarlet<br>
breeches and white stockings. Presently we heard the rustling sound of<br>
silk as my lady came down the flight of stone steps. She stepped round<br>
to look at us; she was a tall, proud-looking woman, and did not<br>
seem pleased about something, but she said nothing, and got into the<br>
carriage. This was the first time of wearing a <span class="GramE">check-rein</span>,
and I must<br>
say, though it certainly was a nuisance not to be able to get my head<br>
down now and then, it did not pull my head higher than I was accustomed<br>
to carry it. I felt anxious about Ginger, but she seemed to be quiet and<br>
content.<br>
<br>
The next day at three o'clock we were again at the door, and the footmen<br>
as before; we heard the silk dress rustle and the lady came down the<br>
steps, and in an imperious voice she said, "York, you must put those<br>
horses' heads higher; they are not fit to be seen."<br>
<br>
York got down, and said very respectfully, "I beg your pardon, my lady,<br>
but these horses have not been reined up for three years, and my lord<br>
said it would be safer to bring them to it by degrees; but if your<br>
ladyship pleases I can take them up a little more."<br>
<br>
"Do so," she said.<br>
<br>
York came round to our heads and shortened the rein himself--one hole,<br>
I think; every little makes a difference, be it for better or worse, and<br>
that day we had a steep hill to go up. Then I began to understand what<br>
I had heard of. Of course, I wanted to put my head forward and take the<br>
carriage up with a will, as we had been used to do; but no, I had to<br>
pull with my head up now, and that took all the spirit out of me, and<br>
the strain came on my back and legs. When we came in Ginger said, "Now<br>
you see what it is like; but this is not bad, and if it does not get<br>
much worse than this I shall say nothing about it, for we are very well<br>
treated here; but if they strain me up tight, why, let 'em look out! I<br>
can't bear it, and I won't."<br>
<br>
Day by day, hole by hole, our bearing reins were shortened, and instead<br>
of looking forward with pleasure to having my harness put on, as I used<br>
to do, I began to dread it. Ginger, too, seemed restless, though she<br>
said very little. At last I thought the worst was over; for several days<br>
there was no more shortening, and I determined to make the best of<br>
it and do my duty, though it was now a constant harass instead of a<br>
pleasure; but the worst was not come.<br>

        <p>1. John told Mr. York that Ginger had been snappish and suspicious when she first arrived, but over three years of good treatment, she became a willing and good-tempered horse. However, he mentioned that Ginger had an irritable constitution, and if ill-used or treated unfairly, she might react negatively. John also informed Mr. York that neither Ginger nor the black horse had ever worn a check-rein, and the dealer mentioned that the gag-bit had spoiled Ginger's temper.</p>
        <p>2. Lady W seemed displeased with the horses' appearance when she first saw them. She asked York to put the horses' heads higher, stating that they were not fit to be seen. This led to the introduction of the check-rein, and Lady W---- insisted on having the horses' heads held higher, despite their not being used to it.</p>

    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<p><br>
One day my lady came down later than usual, and the silk rustled more<br>
than ever.<br>
<br>
"Drive to the Duchess of B----'s," she said, and then after a pause,<br>
"Are you never going to get those horses' heads up, York? Raise them at<br>
once and let us have no more of this humoring and nonsense."<br>
<br>
York came to me first, while the groom stood at Ginger's head. He drew<br>
my head back and fixed the rein so tight that it was almost intolerable;<br>
then he went to Ginger, who was impatiently jerking her head up and down<br>
against the bit, as was her way now. She had a good idea of what was<br>
coming, and the moment York took the rein off the terret <span class="GramE">in
order to</span><br>
shorten it she took her opportunity and reared up so suddenly that York<br>
had his nose roughly hit and his hat knocked off; the groom was nearly<br>
thrown off his legs. At once they both flew to her head; but she was<br>
a match for them, and went on plunging, rearing, and kicking in a most<br>
desperate manner. At <span class="GramE">last</span> she kicked right over the
carriage pole and<br>
fell down, after giving me a severe blow on my near quarter. There is no<br>
knowing what further mischief she might have done had not York promptly<br>
sat himself down flat on her head to prevent her struggling, at the<br>
same time calling out, "Unbuckle the black horse! Run for the winch and<br>
unscrew the carriage pole! Cut the trace here, somebody, if you can't<br>
unhitch it!" One of the footmen ran for the winch, and another brought<br>
a knife from the house. The groom soon set me free from Ginger and the<br>
<span class="GramE">carriage, and</span> led me to my box. He just turned me in
as I was and ran<br>
back to York. I was much excited by what had happened, and if I had ever<br>
been used to kick or rear I am sure I should have done it then; but<br>
I never had, and there I stood, angry, sore in my leg, my head still<br>
strained up to the terret on the saddle, and no power to get it down. I<br>
was very miserable and felt much inclined to kick the first person who<br>
came near me.<br>
<br>
Before long, however, Ginger was led in by two grooms, a good deal<br>
knocked about and bruised. York came with her and gave his orders, and<br>
then came to look at me. In a moment he let down my head.<br>
<br>
"Confound these <span class="GramE">check-reins</span>!" he said to
himself; "I thought we should<br>
have some mischief soon. Master will be sorely vexed. But there, if a<br>
woman's husband can't rule her of course a servant can't; <span class="GramE">so</span>
I wash my<br>
hands of it, and if she can't get to the duchess' garden party I can't<br>
help it."<br>
<br>
York did not say this before the men; he always spoke respectfully when<br>
they were by. Now he felt me all over, and soon found the place above my<br>
hock where I had been kicked. It was swelled and painful; he ordered it<br>
to be sponged with hot water, and then some lotion was put on.<br>
<br>
Lord W---- was much put out when he learned what had happened; he blamed<br>
York for giving way to his mistress, to which he replied that in future<br>
he would much prefer to receive his orders only from his lordship; but<br>
I think nothing came of it, for things went on the same as before. I<br>
thought York might have stood up better for his horses, but perhaps I am<br>
no judge.<br>
<br>
Ginger was never put into the carriage again, but when she was well of<br>
her bruises one of the Lord W----'s younger sons said he should like<br>
to have her; he was sure she would make a good hunter. As for me, I was<br>
obliged still to go in the carriage, and had a fresh partner called Max;<br>
he had always been used to the tight rein. I asked him how it was he<br>
bore it.<br>
<br>
"Well," he said, "I bear it because I must; but it is shortening
my<br>
life, and it will shorten yours too if you have to stick to it."<br>
<br>
"Do you think," I said, "that our masters know how bad it is for
us?"<br>
<br>
"I can't say," he replied, "but the dealers and the
horse-doctors know<br>
it very well. I was at a dealer's once, who was training me and another<br>
horse to go as a pair; he was getting our heads up, as he said, a little<br>
higher and a little higher every day. A gentleman who was there asked<br>
him why he did so. 'Because,' said he, 'people won't buy them unless we<br>
do. The London people always want their horses to carry their heads high<br>
and to step high. <span class="GramE">Of course</span> it is very bad for the
horses, but then it<br>
is good for trade. The horses soon wear up, or get diseased, and they<br>
come for another pair.' That," said Max, "is what he said in my
hearing,<br>
and you can judge for yourself."<br>
<br>
What I suffered with that rein for four long months in my lady's<br>
carriage it would be hard to describe; but I am quite sure that, had it<br>
lasted much longer, either my health or my temper would have given way.<br>
Before that, I never knew what it was to foam at the mouth, but now<br>
the action of the sharp bit on my tongue and jaw, and the constrained<br>
position of my head and throat, always caused me to froth at the mouth<br>
more or less. Some people think it very fine to see this, and say, "What<br>
fine spirited creatures!" But it is just as unnatural for horses as<br>
for men to foam at the mouth; it is a sure sign of some discomfort,<br>
and should be attended to. Besides this, there was a pressure on my<br>
windpipe, which often made my breathing very uncomfortable; when I<br>
returned from my work my neck and chest were strained and painful, my<br>
mouth and tongue tender, and I felt worn and depressed.<br>
<br>
In my old home I always knew that John and my master were my friends;<br>
but here, although in many ways I was well treated, I had no friend.<br>
York might have known, and very likely did know, how that rein harassed<br>
me; but I suppose he took it as a matter of course that it could not be<br>
helped; at any rate, nothing was done to relieve me.<br>

        <p>1. Ginger reared up and created a disturbance when York was adjusting the check-rein because she disliked having her head restrained. She anticipated the discomfort of the check-rein and reacted by rearing, jerking her head, and creating a commotion.</p>
        <p>2. Max explained that the dealer raised the horses' heads higher every day because people preferred horses with high head carriage, especially in London. He mentioned that it was bad for the horses' health, causing them to wear out or get diseased. The dealer's goal was to sell more pairs of horses as they wore down, prioritizing trade over the well-being of the horses.</p>

    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<p><br>
Early in the spring, Lord W---- and part of his family went up to<br>
<span class="GramE">London, and</span> took York with them. I and Ginger and some
other horses were<br>
left at home for use, and the head groom was left in charge.<br>
<br>
The Lady Harriet, who remained at the hall, was a great invalid, and<br>
never went out in the carriage, and the Lady Anne preferred riding on<br>
horseback with her brother or cousins. She was a perfect horsewoman, and<br>
as gay and gentle as she was beautiful. She chose me for her horse, and<br>
named me "Black Auster". I enjoyed these rides very much in the clear<br>
cold air, sometimes with Ginger, sometimes with Lizzie. This Lizzie was<br>
a bright bay mare, almost thoroughbred, and a great favorite with the<br>
gentlemen, on account of her fine action and lively spirit; but Ginger,<br>
who knew more of her than I did, told me she was rather nervous.<br>
<br>
There was a gentleman of the name of Blantyre staying at the hall;<br>
he always rode Lizzie, and praised her so much that one day Lady Anne<br>
ordered the side-saddle to be put on her, and the other saddle on me.<br>
When we came to the door the gentleman seemed very uneasy.<br>
<br>
"How is this?" he said. "Are you tired of your good Black
Auster?"<br>
<br>
"Oh, no, not at all," she replied, "but I am amiable enough to
let you<br>
ride him for once, and I will try your charming Lizzie. You must confess<br>
that in size and appearance she is far more like a lady's horse than my<br>
own favorite."<br>
<br>
"Do let me advise you not to mount her," he said; "she is a
charming<br>
creature, but she is too nervous for a lady. I assure <span class="GramE">you,</span>
she is not<br>
perfectly safe; let me beg you to have the saddles changed."<br>
<br>
"My dear cousin," said Lady Anne, laughing, "pray do not trouble
your<br>
good careful head about me. I have been a horsewoman ever since I was a<br>
baby, and I have followed the hounds a great many times, though I know<br>
you do not approve of ladies hunting; but still that is the fact, and<br>
I intend to try this Lizzie that you gentlemen are all so fond of; so<br>
please help me to mount, like a good friend as you are."<br>
<br>
There was no more to be said; he placed her carefully on the saddle,<br>
looked to the bit and curb, gave the reins gently into her hand, and<br>
then mounted me. Just as we were moving off a footman came out with a<br>
slip of paper and message from the Lady Harriet. "Would they ask this<br>
question for her at Dr. <span class="GramE">Ashley's, and</span> bring the
answer?"<br>
<br>
The village was about a mile off, and the doctor's house was the last<br>
in it. We went along gayly enough till we came to his gate. There was a<br>
short drive up to the house between tall evergreens.<br>
<br>
Blantyre alighted at the gate, and was going to open it for Lady Anne,<br>
but she said, "I will wait for you here, and you can hang Auster's rein<br>
on the gate."<br>
<br>
He looked at her doubtfully. "I will not be five minutes," he said.<br>
<br>
"Oh, do not hurry yourself; Lizzie and I shall not run away from
you."<br>
<br>
He hung my rein on one of the iron spikes, and was soon hidden among the<br>
trees. Lizzie was standing quietly by the side of the road a few paces<br>
off, with her back to me. My young mistress was sitting easily with a<br>
loose rein, humming a little song. I listened to my rider's footsteps<br>
until they reached the <span class="GramE">house, and</span> heard him knock at
the door. There was<br>
a meadow on the opposite side of the road, the gate of which stood open;<br>
just then some cart horses and several young colts came trotting out in<br>
a very disorderly manner, while a boy behind was cracking a great whip.<br>
The colts were wild and frolicsome, and one of them bolted across the<br>
road and blundered up against Lizzie's hind legs, and whether it was<br>
the stupid colt, or the loud cracking of the whip, or both together, I<br>
cannot say, but she gave a violent kick, and dashed off into a headlong<br>
gallop. It was so sudden that Lady Anne was nearly unseated, but she<br>
soon recovered herself. I gave a loud, shrill neigh for help; again and<br>
again I neighed, pawing the ground impatiently, and tossing my head to<br>
get the rein loose. I had not long to wait. Blantyre came running to<br>
the gate; he looked anxiously about, and just caught sight of the flying<br>
figure, now far away on the road. In an instant he sprang to the saddle.<br>
I needed no whip, no spur, for I was as eager as my rider; he saw it,<br>
and giving me a free rein, and leaning a little forward, we dashed after<br>
them.<br>
<br>
For about a mile and a half the road ran straight, and then bent to the<br>
right, after which it divided into two roads. Long before we came to<br>
the bend she was out of sight. Which way had she turned? A woman was<br>
standing at her garden gate, shading her eyes with her hand, and looking<br>
eagerly up the road. Scarcely drawing the rein, Blantyre shouted, "Which<br>
way?" "To the right!" cried the woman, pointing with her hand,
and away<br>
we went up the right-hand road; then for a moment we caught sight of<br>
her; another bend and she was hidden again. Several times we caught<br>
glimpses, and then lost them. We scarcely seemed to gain ground upon<br>
them at all. An old <span class="GramE">road-mender</span> was standing near a
heap of stones, his<br>
shovel dropped and his hands raised. As we came <span class="GramE">near</span>
he made a sign to<br>
speak. Blantyre drew the rein a little. "To the common, to the common,<br>
sir; she has turned off there." I knew this common very well; it was for<br>
the most part very uneven ground, covered with heather and dark-green<br>
furze bushes, with here and there a scrubby old thorn-tree; there were<br>
also open spaces of fine short grass, with ant-hills and mole-turns<br>
everywhere; the worst place I ever knew for a headlong gallop.<br>
<br>
We had hardly turned on the common, when we caught sight again of the<br>
green habit flying on before us. My lady's hat was gone, and her long<br>
brown hair was streaming behind her. Her head and body were thrown back,<br>
as if she were pulling with all her remaining strength, and as if that<br>
strength <span class="GramE">were</span> nearly exhausted. It was clear that the
roughness of the<br>
ground had very much lessened Lizzie's speed, and there seemed a chance<br>
that we might overtake her.<br>
<br>
While we were on the highroad, Blantyre had given me my head; but now,<br>
with a light hand and a practiced eye, he guided me over the ground in<br>
such a masterly manner that my pace was scarcely slackened, and we were<br>
decidedly gaining on them.<br>
<br>
About halfway across the heath there had been a wide dike recently cut,<br>
and the earth from the cutting was cast up roughly on the other side.<br>
Surely this would stop them! But no; with scarcely a pause Lizzie took<br>
the leap, stumbled among the rough clods and fell. Blantyre groaned,<br>
"Now, Auster, do your best!" He gave me a steady rein. I gathered
myself<br>
well together and with one determined leap cleared both dike and bank.<br>
<br>
Motionless among the heather, with her face to the earth, lay my poor<br>
young mistress. Blantyre <span class="GramE">kneeled down</span> and called her
name: there was no<br>
sound. Gently he turned her face upward: it was ghastly white and<br>
the eyes were closed. "Annie, dear Annie, do speak!" But there was no<br>
answer. He unbuttoned her habit, loosened her collar, felt her hands and<br>
wrist, then started up and looked wildly round him for help.<br>
<br>
At no great distance there were two men cutting turf, who, seeing Lizzie<br>
running wild without a rider, had left their work to catch her.<br>
<br>
Blantyre's halloo soon brought them to the spot. The foremost man seemed<br>
much troubled at the sight, and asked what he could do.<br>
<br>
"Can you ride?"<br>
<br>
"Well, sir, I bean't much of a horseman, but I'd risk my neck for the<br>
Lady Anne; she was uncommon good to my wife in the winter."<br>
<br>
"Then mount this horse, my friend--your neck will be quite safe--and<br>
ride to the doctor's and ask him to come instantly; then on to the hall;<br>
tell them all that you know, and bid them send me the carriage, with<br>
Lady Anne's maid and help. I shall stay here."<br>
<br>
"All right, sir, I'll do my best, and I pray God the dear young lady may<br>
open her eyes soon." Then, seeing the other man, he called out,
"Here,<br>
Joe, run for some water, and tell my missis to come as quick as she can<br>
to the Lady Anne."<br>
<br>
He then somehow scrambled into the saddle, and with a "Gee up" and a<br>
clap on my sides with both his legs, he started on his journey, making<br>
a little circuit to avoid the dike. He had no whip, which seemed to<br>
trouble him; but my pace soon cured that difficulty, and he found the<br>
best thing he could do was to stick to the saddle and hold me in, which<br>
he did manfully. I shook him as little as I could help, but once or<br>
twice on the rough ground he called out, "Steady! Woah! Steady!" On
the<br>
highroad we were all right; and at the doctor's and the hall he did his<br>
errand like a good man and true. They asked him in to take a drop of<br>
something. "No, no," he said; "I'll be back to 'em again by a
short cut<br>
through the <span class="GramE">fields, and</span> be there afore the
carriage."<br>
<br>
There was a great deal of hurry and excitement after the news became<br>
known. I was just turned into my box; the saddle and bridle were taken<br>
off, and a cloth thrown over me.<br>
<br>
Ginger was saddled and sent off in great haste for Lord George, and I<br>
soon heard the carriage roll out of the yard.<br>
<br>
It seemed a long time before Ginger came back, and before we were left<br>
alone; and then she told me all that she had seen.<br>
<br>
"I can't tell much," she said. "We went a gallop nearly all the
way, and<br>
got there just as the doctor rode up. There was a woman sitting on the<br>
ground with the lady's head in her lap. The doctor poured something into<br>
her mouth, but all that I heard was, 'She is not dead.' Then I was led<br>
off by a man to a little distance. After awhile she was taken to<br>
the carriage, and we came home together. I heard my master say to<br>
a gentleman who stopped him to inquire, that he hoped no bones were<br>
broken, but that she had not spoken yet."<br>
<br>
When Lord George took Ginger for hunting, York shook his head; he said<br>
it ought to be a steady hand to train a horse for the first season, and<br>
not a random rider like Lord George.<br>
<br>
Ginger used to like it very much, but sometimes when she came back I<br>
could see that she had been very much strained, and now and then she<br>
gave a short cough. She had too much spirit to complain, but I could not<br>
help feeling anxious about her.<br>
<br>
Two days after the accident Blantyre paid me a visit; he patted me and<br>
praised me very much; he told Lord George that he was sure the horse<br>
knew of Annie's danger as well as he did. "I could not have held him in<br>
if I would," said he, "she ought never to ride any other horse."
I found<br>
by their conversation that my young mistress was now out of danger, and<br>
would soon be able to ride again. This was good news to <span class="GramE">me</span>
and I looked<br>
forward to a happy life.<br>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Chapter 25. Reuben Smith</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<p><br>
Now I must say a little about Reuben Smith, who was left in charge of<br>
the stables when York went to London. No one more thoroughly understood<br>
his business than he did, and when he was all right there could not be<br>
a more faithful or valuable man. He was gentle and very clever in his<br>
management of horses, and could doctor them almost as well as a<br>
farrier, for he had lived two years with a veterinary surgeon. He was a<br>
first-rate driver; he could take a four-in-hand or a tandem as easily<br>
as a pair. He was a handsome man, a good scholar, and had very pleasant<br>
manners. I believe everybody liked him; <span class="GramE">certainly</span> the
horses did. The<br>
only wonder was that he should be in an under situation and not in the<br>
place of a head coachman like York; but he had one great fault and that<br>
was the love of drink. He was not like some men, always at it; he used<br>
to keep steady for weeks or months together, and then he would break<br>
out and have a "bout" of it, as York called it, and be a disgrace to<br>
himself, a terror to his wife, and a nuisance to all that had to do with<br>
him. He was, however, so useful that two or three times York had hushed<br>
the matter up and kept it from the earl's knowledge; but one night, when<br>
Reuben had to drive a party home from a ball he was so drunk that he<br>
could not hold the reins, and a gentleman of the party had to mount the<br>
box and drive the ladies home. Of course, this could not be hidden, and<br>
Reuben was at once dismissed; his poor wife and little children had to<br>
turn out of the pretty cottage by the park gate and go where they could.<br>
Old Max told me all this, for it happened a good while ago; but shortly<br>
before Ginger and I came Smith had been taken back again. York had<br>
interceded for him with the earl, who is very kind-hearted, and the man<br>
had promised faithfully that he would never taste another drop as long<br>
as he lived there. He had kept his promise so well that York thought he<br>
might be safely trusted to fill his place while he was away, and he was<br>
so clever and honest that no one else seemed so well fitted for it.<br>
<br>
It was now early in April, and the family was expected home some time in<br>
May. The light brougham was to be fresh done up, and as Colonel Blantyre<br>
was obliged to return to his regiment it was arranged that Smith should<br>
drive him to the town in it, and ride back; for this <span class="GramE">purpose</span>
he took the<br>
saddle with him, and I was chosen for the journey. At the station the<br>
colonel put some money into Smith's hand and bid him good-by, saying,<br>
"Take care of your young mistress, Reuben, and don't let Black Auster be<br>
hacked about by any random young prig that wants to ride him--keep him<br>
for the lady."<br>
<br>
We left the carriage at the maker's, and Smith rode me to the White<br>
Lion, and ordered the hostler to feed me well, and have me ready for him<br>
at four o'clock. A nail in one of my front shoes had started as I came<br>
along, but the hostler did not notice it till just about four o'clock.<br>
Smith did not come into the yard till five, and then he said he should<br>
not leave till six, as he had met with some old friends. The man then<br>
told him of the nail, and asked if he should have the shoe looked to.<br>
<br>
"No," said Smith, "that will be all right till we get
home."<br>
<br>
He spoke in a very loud, offhand way, and I thought it very unlike him<br>
not to see about the shoe, as he was generally wonderfully particular<br>
about loose nails in our shoes. He did not come at six nor seven, nor<br>
eight, and it was nearly nine o'clock before he called for me, and then<br>
it was with a loud, rough voice. He seemed in a very bad temper, and<br>
abused the hostler, though I could not tell what for.<br>
<br>
The landlord stood at the door and said, "Have a care, Mr. Smith!"
but<br>
he answered angrily with an oath; and almost before he was out of the<br>
town he began to gallop, frequently giving me a sharp cut with his whip,<br>
though I was going at full speed. The moon had not yet risen, and it was<br>
very dark. The roads were stony, having been recently mended; going over<br>
them at this pace, my shoe became looser, and as we neared the turnpike<br>
gate it came off.<br>
<br>
If Smith had been in his right senses he would have been sensible of<br>
something wrong in my pace, but he was too drunk to notice.<br>
<br>
Beyond the turnpike was a long piece of road, upon which fresh stones<br>
had just been laid--large sharp stones, over which no horse could be<br>
driven quickly without risk of danger. Over this road, with one shoe<br>
gone, I was forced to gallop at my utmost speed, my rider meanwhile<br>
cutting into me with his whip, and with wild curses urging me to go<br>
still faster. <span class="GramE">Of course</span> my shoeless foot suffered dreadfully;
the hoof<br>
was broken and split down to the very quick, and the inside was terribly<br>
cut by the sharpness of the stones.<br>
<br>
This could not go on; no horse could keep his footing under such<br>
circumstances; the pain was too great. I <span class="GramE">stumbled, and</span>
fell with<br>
violence on both my knees. Smith was flung off by my fall, and, owing to<br>
the speed I was going at, he must have fallen with great force. I soon<br>
recovered my feet and limped to the side of the road, where it was free<br>
from stones. The moon had just risen above the hedge, and by its light<br>
I could see Smith lying a few yards beyond me. He did not rise; he made<br>
one slight effort to do so, and then there was a heavy groan. I could<br>
have groaned, too, for I was suffering intense pain both from my foot<br>
and knees; but horses are used to bear their pain in silence. I uttered<br>
no sound, but I stood there and listened. One more heavy groan from<br>
Smith; but though he now lay in the full moonlight I could see no<br>
motion. I could do nothing for him nor myself, but, oh! how I listened<br>
for the sound of horse, or wheels, or footsteps! The road was not much<br>
frequented, and at this time of the night we might stay for hours before<br>
help came to us. I stood watching and listening. It was a calm, sweet<br>
April night; there were no sounds but a few low notes of a nightingale,<br>
and nothing moved but the white clouds near the moon and a brown owl<br>
that flitted over the hedge. It made me think of the summer nights long<br>
ago, when I used to lie beside my mother in the <span class="GramE">green
pleasant</span> meadow at<br>
Farmer Grey's.<br>

        <p>1. Reuben Smith's main fault was his love of drink. This led to a serious incident where, during a party, he was too drunk to drive, and a gentleman from the party had to take over the reins and drive the ladies home.</p>
        <p>2. When Smith was supposed to ride Black Auster to the town, he arrived at the stable late, in a bad temper and drunk. He neglected to check a loose nail in Black Auster's shoe and galloped recklessly. As a result, Black Auster lost a shoe, and Smith, being drunk and oblivious, continued to ride the horse over a stony road, causing significant injuries to Black Auster's foot and leading to a dangerous situation for both of them.</p>
