<br>
Later on in the evening a traveler's horse was brought in by the second<br>
hostler, and while he was cleaning him a young man with a pipe in his<br>
mouth lounged into the stable to gossip.<br>
<br>
"I say, Towler," said the hostler, "just run up the ladder into
the loft<br>
and put some hay down into this horse's rack, will you? only lay down<br>
your pipe."<br>
<br>
"All right," said the other, and went up through the trapdoor; and I<br>
heard him step across the floor overhead and put down the hay. James<br>
came in to look at us the last thing, and then the door was locked.<br>
<br>
I cannot say how long I had slept, nor what time in the night it was,<br>
but I woke up very uncomfortable, though I hardly knew why. I got up;<br>
the air seemed all thick and choking. I heard Ginger coughing and one<br>
of the other horses seemed very restless; it was quite dark, and I could<br>
see nothing, but the stable seemed full of smoke, and I hardly knew how<br>
to breathe.<br>
<br>
The trapdoor had been left open, and I thought that was the place it<br>
came through. I <span class="GramE">listened, and</span> heard a soft rushing
sort of noise and a<br>
low crackling and snapping. I did not know what it was, but there was<br>
something in the sound so strange that it made me tremble all over. The<br>
other horses were all awake; some were pulling at their halters, others<br>
stamping.<br>
<br>
At last I heard steps outside, and the hostler who had put up the<br>
traveler's horse burst into the stable with a lantern, and began to<br>
untie the horses, and try to lead them out; but he seemed in such a<br>
hurry and so frightened himself that he frightened me still more. The<br>
first horse would not go with him; he tried the second and third, and<br>
they too would not stir. He came to me next and tried to drag me out of<br>
the stall by force; <span class="GramE">of course</span> that was no use. He
tried us all by turns<br>
and then left the stable.<br>
<br>
No doubt we were very foolish, but danger seemed to be all round, and<br>
there was nobody we knew to trust in, and all was strange and uncertain.<br>
The fresh air that had come in through the open door made it easier to<br>
breathe, but the rushing sound overhead grew louder, and as I looked<br>
upward through the bars of my empty rack I saw a red light flickering<br>
on the wall. Then I heard a cry of "Fire!" outside, and the old
hostler<br>
quietly and quickly came in; he got one horse out, and went to another,<br>
but the flames were playing round the trapdoor, and the roaring overhead<br>
was dreadful.<br>
<br>
The next thing I heard was James' voice, quiet and cheery, as it always<br>
was.<br>
<br>
"Come, my beauties, it is time for us to be off, so wake up and come<br>
along." I stood nearest the door, so he came to me first, patting me as<br>
he came in.<br>
<br>
"Come, Beauty, on with your bridle, my boy, we'll soon be out of this<br>
smother." It was on in no time; then he took the scarf off his neck, and<br>
tied it lightly over my eyes, and patting and coaxing he led me out<br>
of the stable. Safe in the yard, he slipped the scarf off my eyes, and<br>
shouted, "Here somebody! take this horse while I go back for the
other."<br>
<br>
A tall, broad man stepped forward and took me, and James darted back<br>
into the stable. I set up a shrill whinny as I saw him go. Ginger told<br>
me afterward that whinny was the best thing I could have done for her,<br>
for had she not heard me outside she would never have had courage to<br>
come out.<br>
<br>
There was much confusion in the yard; the horses being got out of other<br>
stables, and the carriages and gigs being pulled out of houses and<br>
sheds, lest the flames should spread further. On the other side the yard<br>
windows were thrown up, and people were shouting all sorts of things;<br>
but I kept my eye fixed on the stable door, where the smoke poured out<br>
thicker than ever, and I could see flashes of red light; presently I<br>
heard above all the stir and din a loud, clear voice, which I knew was<br>
master's:<br>
<br>
"James Howard! James Howard! Are you there?" There was no answer, but
I<br>
heard a crash of something falling in the stable, and the next moment<br>
I gave a loud, joyful neigh, for I saw James coming through the smoke<br>
leading Ginger with him; she was coughing violently, and he was not able<br>
to speak.<br>
<br>
"My brave lad!" said master, laying his hand on his shoulder,
"are you<br>
hurt?"<br>
<br>
James shook his head, for he could not yet speak.<br>
<br>
"Ay," said the big man who held me; "he is a brave lad, and no
mistake."<br>
<br>
"And now," said master, "when you have got your breath, James,
we'll get<br>
out of this place as quickly as we can," and we were moving toward the<br>
entry, when from the market-place there came a sound of galloping feet<br>
and loud rumbling wheels.<br>
<br>
"'Tis the fire-engine! the fire-engine!" shouted two or three voices,<br>
"stand back, make way!" and clattering and thundering over the stones<br>
two horses dashed into the yard with a heavy engine behind them. The<br>
firemen leaped to the ground; there was no need to ask where the fire<br>
was--it was rolling up in a great blaze from the roof.<br>
<br>
We got out as fast as we could into the broad quiet market-place; the<br>
stars were shining, and except the noise behind us, all was still.<br>
Master led the way to a large hotel on the other side, and as soon as<br>
the hostler came, he said, "James, I must now hasten to your mistress;<br>
I trust the horses entirely to you, order whatever you think is needed,"<br>
and with that he was gone. The master did not run, but I never saw<br>
mortal man <span class="GramE">walk</span> so fast as he did that night.<br>
<br>
There was a dreadful sound before we got into our stalls--the shrieks of<br>
those poor horses that were left burning to death in the stable--it was<br>
very terrible! and made both Ginger and me feel very bad. We, however,<br>
were taken in and well done by.<br>
<br>
The next morning the master came to see how we were and to speak to<br>
James. I did not hear much, for the hostler was rubbing me down, but<br>
I could see that James looked very happy, and I thought the master was<br>
proud of him. Our mistress had been so much alarmed in the night that<br>
the journey was put off till the afternoon, so James had the morning<br>
on hand, and went first to the inn to see about our harness and the<br>
carriage, and then to hear more about the fire. When he came <span class="GramE">back</span>
we<br>
heard him tell the hostler about it. At first no one could guess how the<br>
fire had been caused, but at last a man said he saw Dick Towler go into<br>
the stable with a pipe in his mouth, and when he came <span class="GramE">out</span>
he had not<br>
one, and went to the tap for another. Then the under hostler said he had<br>
asked Dick to go up the ladder to put down some <span class="GramE">hay, but</span>
told him to lay<br>
down his pipe first. Dick denied taking the pipe with him, but no one<br>
believed him. I remember our John Manly's rule, never to allow a pipe in<br>
the stable, and thought it ought to be the rule everywhere.<br>
<br>
James said the roof and floor had all fallen in, and that only the black<br>
walls were standing; the two poor horses that could not be got out were<br>
buried under the burnt rafters and tiles.<br>

        <p>1. James untied the horses and tried to lead them out of the burning stable. His action was important because it saved the horses from the fire and showed his bravery and care for the animals.</p>
        <p>2. The horses were restless, some pulling at their halters, others stamping. The narrator whinnied to alert the others outside and provide courage for Ginger to come out, as Ginger later told the narrator.</p>

<br>
The rest of our journey was very easy, and a little after sunset we<br>
reached the house of my master's friend. We were taken into a clean,<br>
snug stable; there was a kind coachman, who made us very comfortable,<br>
and who seemed to think a good deal of James when he heard about the<br>
fire.<br>
<br>
"There is one thing quite clear, young man," he said, "your
horses know<br>
who they can trust; it is one of the hardest things in the world to get<br>
horses out of a stable when there is either fire or flood. I don't know<br>
why they won't come out, but they won't--not one in twenty."<br>
<br>
We stopped two or three days at this place and then returned home. All<br>
went well on the journey; we were glad to be in our own stable again,<br>
and John was equally glad to see us.<br>
<br>
Before he and James left us for the night James said, "I wonder who is<br>
coming in my place."<br>
<br>
"Little Joe Green at the lodge," said John.<br>
<br>
"Little Joe Green! why, he's a child!"<br>
<br>
"He is fourteen and a half," said John.<br>
<br>
"But he is such a little chap!"<br>
<br>
"Yes, he is small, but he is quick and willing, and kind-hearted, too,<br>
and then he wishes very much to come, and his father would like it;<br>
and I know the master would like to give him the chance. He said if I<br>
thought he would not do he would look out for a bigger boy; but I said I<br>
was quite agreeable to try him for six weeks."<br>
<br>
"Six weeks!" said James; "why, it will be six months before he
can be of<br>
much use! It will make you a deal of work, John."<br>
<br>
"Well," said John with a laugh, "work and I are very good friends;
I<br>
never was afraid of work yet."<br>
<br>
"You are a very good man," said James. "I wish I may ever be
like you."<br>
<br>
"I don't often speak of myself," said John, "but as you are
going away<br>
from us out into the world to shift for yourself I'll just tell you how<br>
I look on these things. I was just as old as Joseph when my father and<br>
mother died of the fever within ten days of <span class="GramE">each other, and</span>
left me and<br>
my cripple sister Nelly alone in the world, without a relation that we<br>
could look to for help. I was a farmer's boy, not earning enough to keep<br>
myself, much less both of us, and she must have gone to the workhouse<br>
but for our mistress (Nelly calls her her angel, and she has good right<br>
to do so). She went and hired a room for her with old Widow Mallet, and<br>
she gave her knitting and needlework when she was able to do it; and<br>
when she was <span class="GramE">ill</span> she sent her dinners and many nice,
comfortable things,<br>
and was like a mother to her. Then the master he took me into the stable<br>
under old Norman, the coachman that was then. I had my food at the house<br>
and my bed in the loft, and a suit of clothes, and three shillings a<br>
week, so that I could help Nelly. Then there was Norman; he might have<br>
turned round and said at his age he could not be troubled with a raw boy<br>
from the plow-tail, but he was like a father to me, and took no end of<br>
pains with me. When the old man died some years after I stepped into his<br>
place, and now of course I have top wages, and can lay by for a rainy<br>
day or a sunny day, as it may happen, and Nelly is as happy as a bird.<br>
So you see, James, I am not the man that should turn up his nose at a<br>
little boy and vex a good, kind master. No, no! I shall miss you very<br>
much, James, but we shall pull through, and there's nothing like doing a<br>
kindness when 'tis put in your way, and I am glad I can do it."<br>
<br>
"Then," said James, "you don't hold with that saying, 'Everybody
look<br>
after himself, and take care of number one'?"<br>
<br>
"No, indeed," said John, "where should I and Nelly have been if
master<br>
and mistress and old Norman had only taken care of number one? Why,<br>
she in the workhouse and I hoeing turnips! Where would Black Beauty and<br>
Ginger have been if you had only thought of number one? why, roasted to<br>
death! No, Jim, no! that is a selfish, heathenish saying, whoever uses<br>
it; and any man who thinks he has nothing to do but take care of number<br>
one, why, it's a pity but what he had been drowned like a puppy or a<br>
kitten, before he got his eyes open; that's what I think," said John,<br>
with a very decided jerk of his head.<br>
<br>
James laughed at this; but there was a thickness in his voice when he<br>
said, "You have been my best friend except my mother; I hope you won't<br>
forget me."<br>
<br>
"No, lad, no!" said John, "and if ever I can do you a good turn
I hope<br>
you won't forget me."<br>
<br>
The next day Joe came to the stables to learn all he could before James<br>
left. He learned to sweep the stable, to bring in the straw and hay; he<br>
began to clean the <span class="GramE">harness, and</span> helped to wash the
carriage. As he was<br>
quite too short to do anything in the way of grooming Ginger and me,<br>
James taught him upon Merrylegs, for he was to have full charge of<br>
him, under John. He was a nice little bright fellow, and always came<br>
whistling to his work.<br>
<br>
Merrylegs was a good deal put out at being "mauled about," as he
said,<br>
"by a boy who knew nothing;" but toward the end of the second week he<br>
told me confidentially that he thought the boy would turn out well.<br>
<br>
At last the day came when James had to leave us; cheerful as he always<br>
was, he looked quite down-hearted that morning.<br>
<br>
"You see," he said to John, "I am leaving a great deal behind;
my mother<br>
and Betsy, and you, and a good master and mistress, and then the horses,<br>
and my old Merrylegs. At the new place there will not be a soul that I<br>
shall know. If it were not that I shall get a higher place, and be able<br>
to help my mother better, I don't think I should have made up my mind to<br>
it; it is a real pinch, John."<br>
<br>
"Ay, James, lad, so it is; but I should not think much of you if you<br>
could leave your home for the first time and not feel it. Cheer up,<br>
you'll make friends there; and if you get on well, as I am sure you<br>
will, it will be a fine thing for your mother, and she will be proud<br>
enough that you have got into such a good place as that."<br>
<br>
So John cheered him up, but every one was sorry to lose James; as for<br>
Merrylegs, he pined after him for several days, and went quite off his<br>
appetite. So John took him out several mornings with a leading rein,<br>
when he exercised me, and, trotting and galloping by my side, got up the<br>
little fellow's spirits again, and he was soon all right.<br>
<br>
Joe's father would often come in and give a little help, as he<br>
understood the work; and Joe took a great deal of pains to learn, and<br>
John was quite encouraged about him.<br>

        <p>2. John took Merrylegs out several mornings with a leading rein, exercising him and allowing Joe to trot and gallop by Merrylegs' side. This helped the little fellow regain his spirits and appetite, making the transition easier for him.</p>

    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
One night, a few days after James had left, I had eaten my hay and was<br>
lying down in my straw fast asleep, when I was suddenly roused by the<br>
stable bell ringing very loud. I heard the door of John's house open,<br>
and his feet running up to the hall. He was back again in no time; he<br>
unlocked the stable door, and came in, calling out, "Wake up, Beauty!<br>
You must go well now, if ever you did;" and almost before I could think<br>
he had got the saddle on my back and the bridle on my head. He just<br>
ran round for his coat, and then took me at a quick trot up to the hall<br>
door. The squire stood there, with a lamp in his hand.<br>
<br>
"Now, John," he said, "ride for your life--that is, for your
mistress'<br>
life; there is not a moment to lose. Give this note to Dr. White; give<br>
your horse a rest at the <span class="GramE">inn, and</span> be back as soon as
you can."<br>
<br>
John said, "Yes, sir," and was on my back in a minute. The gardener
who<br>
lived at the lodge had heard the bell ring, and was ready with the gate<br>
open, and away we went through the park, and through the village, and<br>
down the hill till we came to the <span class="GramE">toll-gate</span>. John
called very loud and<br>
thumped upon the door; the man was soon out and flung open the gate.<br>
<br>
"Now," said John, "do you keep the gate open for the doctor;
here's the<br>
money," and off he went again.<br>
<br>
There was before us a long piece of level road by the river side; John<br>
said to me, "Now, Beauty, do your best," and so I did; I wanted no
whip<br>
nor spur, and for two miles I galloped as fast as I could lay my feet to<br>
the ground; I don't believe that my old grandfather, who won the race<br>
at Newmarket, could have gone faster. When we came to the bridge John<br>
pulled me up a little and patted my neck. "Well done, Beauty! good old<br>
fellow," he said. He would have let me go slower, but my spirit was up,<br>
and I was off again as fast as before. The air was frosty, the moon was<br>
bright; it was very pleasant. We came through a village, then through<br>
a dark wood, then uphill, then downhill, till after eight miles' <span class="GramE">run</span> we<br>
came to the town, through the streets and into the market-place. It was<br>
all quite still except the clatter of my feet on the stones--everybody<br>
was asleep. The church clock struck three as we drew up at Dr. White's<br>
door. John rang the bell twice, and then knocked at the door like<br>
thunder. A window was thrown up, and Dr. White, in his nightcap, put his<br>
head out and said, "What do you want?"<br>
<br>
"Mrs. Gordon is very ill, sir; master wants you to go at once; he thinks<br>
she will die if you cannot get there. Here is a note."<br>
<br>
"Wait," he said, "I will come."<br>
<br>
He shut the <span class="GramE">window, and</span> was soon at the door.<br>
<br>
"The worst of it is," he said, "that my horse has been out all
day and<br>
is quite done up; my son has just been sent for, and he has taken the<br>
other. What is to be done? Can I have your horse?"<br>
<br>
"He has come at a gallop nearly all the way, sir, and I was to give him<br>
a rest here; but I think my master would not be against it, if you think<br>
fit, sir."<br>
<br>
"All right," he said; "I will soon be ready."<br>
<br>
John stood by me and stroked my neck; I was very hot. The doctor came<br>
out with his riding-whip.<br>
<br>
"You need not take that, sir," said John; "Black Beauty will go
till he<br>
drops. Take care of him, sir, if you can; I should not like any harm to<br>
come to him."<br>
<br>
"No, no, John," said the doctor, "I hope not," and in a
minute we had<br>
left John far behind.<br>
<br>
I will not <span class="GramE">tell</span> about our way back. The doctor was a
heavier man than<br>
John, and not so good a rider; however, I did my very best. The man at<br>
the <span class="GramE">toll-gate</span> had it open. When we came to the hill
the doctor drew me<br>
up. "Now, my good fellow," he said, "take some breath." I
was glad he<br>
did, for I was nearly spent, but that breathing helped me on, and soon<br>
we were in the park. Joe was at the lodge gate; my master was at the<br>
hall door, for he had heard us coming. He spoke not a word; the doctor<br>
went into the house with him, and Joe led me to the stable. I was glad<br>
to get home; my legs shook under me, and I could only stand and pant. I<br>
had not a dry hair on my body, the water ran down my legs, and I steamed<br>
all over, Joe used to say, like a pot on the fire. Poor Joe! he was<br>
young and small, and <span class="GramE">as yet</span> he knew very little, and
his father, who<br>
would have helped him, had been sent to the next village; but I am sure<br>
he did the very best he knew. He rubbed my legs and my chest, but he did<br>
not put my warm cloth on me; he thought I was so hot I should not like<br>
it. Then he gave me a pailful of water to drink; it was cold and very<br>
good, and I drank it all; then he gave me some hay and some corn, and<br>
thinking he had done right, he went away. Soon I began to shake and<br>
tremble, and turned deadly cold; my legs ached, my loins ached, and my<br>
chest ached, and I felt sore all over. Oh! how I wished for my warm,<br>
thick cloth, as I stood and trembled. I wished for John, but he had<br>
eight miles to walk, so I lay down in my straw and tried to go to sleep.<br>
After a long while I heard John at the door; I gave a low moan, for I<br>
was in great pain. He was at my side in a moment, stooping down by me. I<br>
could not tell him how I felt, but he seemed to know it all; he covered<br>
me up with two or three warm cloths, and then ran to the house for some<br>
hot water; he made me some warm gruel, which I drank, and then I think I<br>
went to sleep.<br>
<br>
John seemed to be very much put out. I heard him say to himself over and<br>
over again, "Stupid boy! stupid boy! no cloth put on, and I dare say the<br>
water was cold, too; boys are no good;" but Joe was a good boy, after<br>
all.<br>
<br>
I was now very ill; a strong inflammation had attacked my lungs, and I<br>
could not draw my breath without pain. John nursed me night and day; he<br>
would get up two or three times in the night to come to me. My master,<br>
too, often came to see me. "My poor Beauty," he said one day,
"my good<br>
horse, you saved your mistress' life, Beauty; yes, you saved her life."<br>
I was very glad to hear that, for it seems the doctor had said if we had<br>
been a little longer it would have been too late. John told my master he<br>
never saw a horse go so fast in his life. It seemed as if the horse knew<br>
what was the matter. <span class="GramE">Of course</span> I did, though John
thought not; at least<br>
I knew as much as this--that John and I must go at the top of our speed,<br>
and that it was for the sake of the mistress.<br>

        <p>1. John came to the stable and saddled Black Beauty in the middle of the night because Mrs. Gordon was very ill, and the master needed John to quickly fetch the doctor. The squire thought Mrs. Gordon might die if the doctor didn't come immediately.</p>
        <p>2. After the long, fast run to get the doctor, Black Beauty was very tired and almost spent. His legs shook, he panted, and he was covered in sweat. Despite being tired, Black Beauty felt relieved to be home.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>CHAPTER 19. Only Ignorance</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
I do not know how long I was ill. Mr. Bond, the horse-doctor, came every<br>
day. One day he bled me; John held a pail for the blood. I felt very<br>
faint after it and thought I should die, and I believe they all thought<br>
so too.<br>
<br>
Ginger and Merrylegs had been moved into the other stable, so that I<br>
might be quiet, for the fever made me very quick of hearing; any little<br>
noise seemed quite loud, and I could tell every one's footstep going to<br>
and from the house. I knew all that was going on. One night John had to<br>
give me a draught; Thomas Green came in to help him. After I had taken<br>
it and John had made me as comfortable as he could, he said he should<br>
stay half an hour to see how the medicine settled. Thomas said he<br>
would stay with him, so they went and sat down on a bench that had been<br>
brought into Merrylegs' stall, and put down the lantern at their feet,<br>
that I might not be disturbed with the light.<br>
<br>
For awhile both men sat silent, and then Tom Green said in a low voice:<br>
<br>
"I wish, John, you'd say a bit of a kind word to Joe. The boy is quite<br>
broken-hearted; he can't eat his meals, and he can't smile. He says he<br>
knows it was all his fault, though he is sure he did the best he knew,<br>
and he says if Beauty dies no one will ever speak to him again. It goes<br>
to my heart to hear him. I think you might give him just a word; he is<br>
not a bad boy."<br>
<br>
After a short pause John said slowly, "You must not be too hard upon me,<br>
Tom. I know he meant no harm, I never said he did; I know he is not a<br>
bad boy. But you see, I am sore myself; that horse is the pride of my<br>
heart, to say nothing of his being such a favorite with the master and<br>
mistress; and to think that his life may be flung away in this manner is<br>
more than I can bear. But if you think I am hard on the boy I will try<br>
to give him a good word to-morrow--that is, I mean if Beauty is better."<br>
<br>
"Well, John, thank you. I knew you did not wish to be too hard, and I am<br>
glad you see it was only ignorance."<br>
<br>
John's voice almost startled me as he answered:<br>
<br>
"Only ignorance! only ignorance! how can you talk about only ignorance?<br>
Don't you know that it is the worst thing in the world, next to<br>
wickedness?--and which does the most mischief heaven only knows. If<br>
people can say, 'Oh! I did not know, I did not mean any harm,' they<br>
think it is all right. I suppose Martha Mulwash did not mean to kill<br>
that baby when she dosed it with Dalby and soothing syrups; but she did<br>
kill <span class="GramE">it, and</span> was tried for manslaughter."<br>
<br>
"And serve her right, too," said Tom. "A woman should not
undertake to<br>
nurse a tender little child without knowing what is good and what is bad<br>
for it."<br>
<br>
"Bill Starkey," continued John, "did not mean to frighten his
brother<br>
into fits when he dressed up like a ghost and ran after him in the<br>
moonlight; but he did; and that bright, handsome little fellow, that<br>
might have been the pride of any mother's heart is just no better than<br>
an idiot, and never will be, if he lives to be eighty years old. You<br>
were a good deal cut up yourself, Tom, two weeks ago, when those young<br>
ladies left your hothouse door open, with a frosty east wind blowing<br>
right in; you said it killed a good many of your plants."<br>
<br>
"A good many!" said Tom; "there was not one of the tender
cuttings that<br>
was not nipped off. I shall have to strike all over again, and the worst<br>
of it is that I don't know where to go to get fresh ones. I was nearly<br>
mad when I came in and saw what was done."<br>
<br>
"And yet," said John, "I am sure the young ladies did not mean
it; it<br>
was only ignorance."<br>
<br>
I heard no more of this conversation, for the medicine did well and sent<br>
me to sleep, and in the morning I felt much better; but I often thought<br>
of John's words when I came to know more of the world.<br>

        <p>1. Joe was feeling broken-hearted because he believed it was his fault that Black Beauty was sick. Tom Green asked John to say a kind word to Joe because he was not eating or smiling, feeling guilty about what happened to Black Beauty, and thought that if Beauty died, no one would ever speak to him again.</p>
        <p>2. John said that ignorance is the worst thing in the world next to wickedness, and it can cause a lot of harm. He mentioned Martha Mulwash, who unintentionally killed a baby by dosing it with the wrong medicine, and Bill Starkey, who frightened his brother into fits by dressing up as a ghost. John used these examples to emphasize the serious consequences of actions that result from ignorance.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>CHAPTER 20. Joe Green</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
Joe Green went on very well; he learned quickly, and was so attentive<br>
and careful that John began to trust him in many things; but as I have<br>
said, he was small of his age, and it was seldom that he was allowed to<br>
exercise either Ginger or me; but it so happened one morning that John<br>
was out with Justice in the luggage cart, and the master wanted a<br>
note to be taken immediately to a gentleman's house, about three miles<br>
distant, and sent his orders for Joe to saddle me and take it, adding<br>
the caution that he was to ride steadily.<br>
<br>
The note was delivered, and we were quietly returning when we came<br>
to the brick-field. Here we saw a cart heavily laden with bricks; the<br>
wheels had stuck fast in the stiff mud of some deep ruts, and the carter<br>
was shouting and flogging the two horses unmercifully. Joe pulled up. It<br>
was a sad sight. There were the two horses straining and struggling with<br>
all their might to drag the cart out, but they could not move it; the<br>
sweat streamed from their legs and flanks, their sides heaved, and every<br>
muscle was strained, while the man, fiercely pulling at the head of the<br>
fore horse, swore and lashed most brutally.<br>
<br>
"Hold hard," said Joe; "don't go on flogging the horses like
that; the<br>
wheels are so stuck that they cannot move the cart."<br>
<br>
The man took no heed, but went on lashing.<br>
<br>
"Stop! pray stop!" said Joe. "I'll help you to lighten the cart;
they<br>
can't move it now."<br>
<br>
"Mind your own business, you impudent young rascal, and I'll mind
mine!"<br>
The man was in a towering passion and the worse for <span class="GramE">drink,
and</span> laid on<br>
the whip again. Joe turned my head, and the next moment we were going at<br>
a round gallop toward the house of the master brick-maker. I cannot say<br>
if John would have approved of our pace, but Joe and I were both of one<br>
mind, and so angry that we could not have gone slower.<br>
<br>
The house stood close by the roadside. Joe knocked at the door, and<br>
shouted, "Halloo! Is Mr. Clay at home?" The door was opened, and Mr.<br>
Clay himself came out.<br>
<br>
"Halloo, young man! You seem in a hurry; any orders from the squire this<br>
morning?"<br>
<br>
"No, Mr. Clay, but there's a fellow in your brick-yard flogging two<br>
horses to death. I told him to stop, and he wouldn't; I said I'd help<br>
him to lighten the cart, and he wouldn't; <span class="GramE">so</span> I have
come to tell you.<br>
Pray, sir, go." Joe's voice shook with excitement.<br>
<br>
"Thank ye, my lad," said the man, running in for his hat; then
pausing<br>
for a moment, "Will you give evidence of what you saw if I should bring<br>
the fellow up before a magistrate?"<br>
<br>
"That I will," said Joe, "and glad too." The man was gone,
and we were<br>
on our way home at a smart trot.<br>
<br>
"Why, what's the matter with you, Joe? You look angry all over," said<br>
John, as the boy flung himself from the saddle.<br>
<br>
"I am angry all over, I can tell you,<span class="GramE">" said</span>
the boy, and then in<br>
hurried, excited words he told all that had happened. Joe was usually<br>
such a quiet, gentle little fellow that it was wonderful to see him so<br>
roused.<br>
<br>
"Right, Joe! you did right, my boy, whether the fellow gets a summons or<br>
not. Many folks would have ridden by and said it was not their<br>
business to interfere. Now I say that with cruelty and oppression it is<br>
everybody's business to interfere when they see it; you did right, my<br>
boy."<br>
<br>
Joe was quite calm by this time, and proud that John approved of him,<br>
and cleaned out my feet and rubbed me down with a firmer hand than<br>
usual.<br>
<br>
They were just going home to dinner when the footman came down to the<br>
stable to say that Joe was wanted directly in master's private room;<br>
there was a man brought up for ill-using horses, and Joe's evidence was<br>
wanted. The boy flushed up to his forehead, and his eyes sparkled. "They<br>
shall have it," said he.<br>
<br>
"Put yourself a bit straight," said John. Joe gave a pull at his
necktie<br>
and a twitch at his <span class="GramE">jacket, and</span> was off in a moment.
Our master being<br>
one of the county magistrates, cases were often brought to him to<br>
settle, or say what should be done. In the stable we heard no more for<br>
some time, as it was the men's dinner hour, but when Joe came next into<br>
the stable I saw he was in high spirits; he gave me a good-natured slap,<br>
and said, "We won't see such things done, will we, old fellow?" We
heard<br>
afterward that he had given his evidence so clearly, and the horses were<br>
in such an exhausted state, bearing marks of such brutal usage, that the<br>
carter was committed to take his trial, and might possibly be sentenced<br>
to two or three months in prison.<br>
<br>
It was wonderful what a change had come over Joe. John <span class="GramE">laughed,
and</span> said<br>
he had grown an inch taller in that week, and I believe he had. He<br>
was just as kind and gentle as before, but there was more purpose and<br>
determination in all that he did--as if he had jumped at once from a boy<br>
into a man.<br>
