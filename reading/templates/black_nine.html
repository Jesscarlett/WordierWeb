    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<p><br>
I saw a great deal of trouble among the horses in London, and much of<br>
it might have been prevented by a little common sense. We horses do not<br>
mind hard work if we are treated reasonably, and I am sure there are<br>
many driven by quite poor men who have a happier life than I had when I<br>
used to go in the Countess of W----'s carriage, with my silver-mounted<br>
harness and high feeding.<br>
<br>
It often went to my heart to see how the little ponies were used,<br>
straining along with heavy loads or staggering under heavy blows from<br>
some low, cruel boy. Once I saw a little gray pony with a thick mane<br>
and a pretty head, and so much like Merrylegs that if I had not been in<br>
harness I should have neighed to him. He was doing his best to pull a<br>
heavy cart, while a strong rough boy was cutting him under the belly<br>
with his whip and chucking cruelly at his little mouth. Could it be<br>
Merrylegs? It was just like him; but then Mr. Blomefield was never to<br>
sell him, and I think he would not do it; but this might have been quite<br>
as good a little fellow, and had as happy a place when he was young.<br>
<br>
I often noticed the great speed at which butchers' horses were made to<br>
go, though I did not know why it was so till one day when we had to wait<br>
some time in St. John's Wood. There was a butcher's shop next door, and<br>
as we were standing a butcher's cart came dashing up at a great pace.<br>
The horse was hot and much exhausted; he hung his head down, while his<br>
heaving sides and trembling legs showed how hard he had been driven. The<br>
lad jumped out of the cart and was getting the basket when the master<br>
came out of the shop much displeased. After looking at the horse he<br>
turned angrily to the lad.<br>
<br>
"How many times shall I tell you not to drive in this way? You ruined<br>
the last horse and broke his wind, and you are going to ruin this in the<br>
same way. If you were not my own son I would dismiss you on the spot;<br>
it is a disgrace to have a horse brought to the shop in a condition like<br>
that; you are liable to be taken up by the police for such driving, and<br>
if you are you need not look to me for bail, for I have spoken to you<br>
till I'm tired; you must look out for yourself."<br>
<br>
During this speech the boy had stood by, sullen and dogged, but when his<br>
father ceased he broke out angrily. It wasn't his fault, and he wouldn't<br>
take the blame; he was only going by orders all the time.<br>
<br>
"You always say, 'Now be quick; now look sharp!' and when I go to the<br>
houses one wants a leg of mutton for an early dinner and I must be back<br>
with it in a quarter of an hour; another cook has forgotten to order<br>
the beef; I must go and fetch it and be back in no time, or the<br>
mistress will scold; and the housekeeper says they have company coming<br>
unexpectedly and must have some chops sent up directly; and the lady at<br>
No. 4, in the Crescent, never orders her dinner till the meat comes<br>
in for lunch, and it's nothing but hurry, hurry, all the time. If the<br>
gentry would think of what they want, and order their meat the day<br>
before, there need not be this blow up!"<br>
<br>
"I wish to goodness they would," said the butcher; "'twould save
me a<br>
wonderful deal of harass, and I could suit my customers much better if<br>
I knew beforehand--But there! what's the use of talking--who ever thinks<br>
of a butcher's convenience or a butcher's horse! Now, then, take him<br>
in and look to him well; mind, he does not go out again to-day, and if<br>
anything else is wanted you must carry it yourself in the basket." With<br>
that he went in, and the horse was led away.<br>
<br>
But all boys are not cruel. I have seen some as fond of their pony or<br>
donkey as if it had been a favorite dog, and the little creatures have<br>
worked away as cheerfully and willingly for their young drivers as I<br>
work for Jerry. It may be hard work sometimes, but a friend's hand and<br>
voice make it easy.<br>
<br>
There was a young coster-boy who came up our street with greens and<br>
potatoes; he had an old pony, not very handsome, but the cheerfullest<br>
and pluckiest little thing I ever saw, and to see how fond those two<br>
were of each other was a treat. The pony followed his master like a dog,<br>
and when he got into his cart would trot off without a whip or a word,<br>
and rattle down the street as merrily as if he had come out of the<br>
queen's stables. Jerry liked the boy, and called him "Prince
Charlie",<br>
for he said he would make a king of drivers some day.<br>
<br>
There was an old man, too, who used to come up our street with a little<br>
coal cart; he wore a coal-heaver's <span class="GramE">hat, and</span> looked
rough and black. He<br>
and his old horse used to plod together along the street, like two good<br>
partners who understood each other; the horse would stop of his own<br>
accord at the doors where they took coal of him; he used to keep one ear<br>
bent toward his master. The old man's cry could be heard up the street<br>
long before he came near. I never knew what he said, but the children<br>
called him "Old Ba-a-ar Hoo", for it sounded like that. Polly took
her<br>
coal of him, and was very friendly, and Jerry said it was a comfort to<br>
think how happy an old horse might be in a poor place.<br>

        <p>1. The horse in the butcher's cart was hot and exhausted because it had been driven at a great pace. The master scolded the boy, expressing his displeasure, warning about ruining the horse's health, and mentioning the potential legal consequences of such driving.</p>
        <p>2. The young coster-boy and his pony had a very affectionate and cheerful relationship. The pony followed the boy like a dog, trotting off without needing a whip, and they seemed fond of each other. Jerry called the boy "Prince Charlie" because he believed the boy had the potential to become an excellent and respected driver, like a king among drivers.</p>

    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
    <p><br>
As we came into the yard one afternoon Polly came out. "Jerry! I've had<br>
Mr. B---- here asking about your vote, and he wants to hire your cab for<br>
the election; he will call for an answer."<br>
<br>
"Well, Polly, you may say that my cab will be otherwise engaged. I<br>
should not like to have it pasted over with their great bills, and as<br>
to making Jack and Captain race about to the public-houses to bring up<br>
half-drunken voters, why, I think 'twould be an insult to the horses.<br>
No, I shan't do it."<br>
<br>
"I suppose you'll vote for the gentleman? He said he was of your<br>
politics."<br>
<br>
"So he is in some things, but I shall not vote for him, Polly; you know<br>
what his trade is?"<br>
<br>
"Yes."<br>
<br>
"Well, a man who gets rich by that trade may be all very well in some<br>
ways, but he is blind as to what workingmen want; I could not in my<br>
conscience send him up to make the laws. I dare say they'll be angry,<br>
but every man must do what he thinks to be the best for his country."<br>
<br>
On the morning before the election, Jerry was putting me into the<br>
shafts, when Dolly came into the yard sobbing and crying, with her<br>
little blue frock and white pinafore spattered all over with mud.<br>
<br>
"Why, Dolly, what is the matter?"<br>
<br>
"Those naughty boys," she sobbed, "have thrown the dirt all over
me, and<br>
called me a little raga--raga--"<br>
<br>
"They called her a little 'blue' ragamuffin, father," said Harry, who<br>
ran in looking very angry; "but I have given it to them; they won't<br>
insult my sister again. I have given them a thrashing they will<br>
remember; a set of cowardly, rascally 'orange' blackguards."<br>
<br>
Jerry kissed the child and said, "Run in to mother, my pet, and tell her<br>
I think you had better stay at home to-day and help her."<br>
<br>
Then turning gravely to Harry:<br>
<br>
"My boy, I hope you will always defend your sister, and give anybody who<br>
insults her a good thrashing--that is as it should be; but mind, I won't<br>
have any election blackguarding on my premises. There are as many<br>
'blue' blackguards as there are 'orange', and as many white as there are<br>
purple, or any other color, and I won't have any of my family mixed up<br>
with it. Even women and children are ready to quarrel for the sake of a<br>
color, and not one in ten of them knows what it is about."<br>
<br>
"Why, father, I thought blue was for Liberty."<br>
<br>
"My boy, Liberty does not come from colors, they only show party, and<br>
all the liberty you can get out of them is, liberty to get drunk at<br>
other people's expense, liberty to ride to the poll in a dirty old cab,<br>
liberty to abuse any one that does not wear your color, and to shout<br>
yourself hoarse at what you only half-understand--that's your liberty!"<br>
<br>
"Oh, father, you are laughing."<br>
<br>
"No, Harry, I am serious, and I am ashamed to see how men go on who<br>
ought to know better. An election is a very serious thing; at least it<br>
ought to be, and every man ought to vote according to his conscience,<br>
and let his neighbor do the same."<br>

        <p>1. Jerry refused to let his cab be used for the election because he didn't want it covered with election posters, and he thought it would be an insult to the horses to use them for transporting half-drunken voters. Jerry was also concerned about the candidate's trade, believing that a man who got rich through that trade might not understand what workingmen needed.</p>
        <p>2. Jerry comforted Dolly and advised her to stay at home for the day to help her mother. When Harry, Dolly's brother, came in angry and mentioned giving the boys who insulted her a thrashing, Jerry approved of defending his sister but emphasized that he didn't want any election-related violence or blackguarding on his premises. He encouraged Harry to stand up for his sister but warned against getting involved in the color-based conflicts of the election.</p>

    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<p><br>
The election day came at last; there was no lack of work for Jerry and<br>
me. First came a stout puffy gentleman with a carpet bag; he wanted to<br>
go to the Bishopsgate station; then we were called by a party who wished<br>
to be taken to the Regent's Park; and next we were wanted in a side<br>
street where a timid, anxious old lady was waiting to be taken to the<br>
bank; there we had to stop to take her back again, and just as we had<br>
set her down a red-faced gentleman, with a handful of papers, came<br>
running up out of breath, and before Jerry could get down he had opened<br>
the door, popped himself in, and called out, "Bow Street Police Station,<br>
quick!" so off we went with him, and when after another turn or two<br>
we came back, there was no other cab on the stand. Jerry put on my<br>
nose-bag, for as he said, "We must eat when we can on such days as<br>
these; so munch away, Jack, and make the best of your time, old boy."<br>
<br>
I found I had a good feed of crushed oats wetted up with a little bran;<br>
this would be a treat any day, but very refreshing then. Jerry was so<br>
thoughtful and kind--what horse would not do his best for such a master?<br>
Then he took out one of Polly's meat pies, and standing near me, he<br>
began to eat it. The streets were very full, and the cabs, with the<br>
candidates' colors on them, were dashing about through the crowd as if<br>
life and limb were of no consequence; we saw two people knocked down<br>
that day, and one was a woman. The horses were having a bad time of it,<br>
poor things! but the voters inside thought nothing of that; many of them<br>
were half-drunk, hurrahing out of the cab windows if their own party<br>
came by. It was the first election I had seen, and I don't want to be in<br>
another, though I have heard things are better now.<br>
<br>
Jerry and I had not eaten many mouthfuls before a poor young woman,<br>
carrying a heavy child, came along the street. She was <span class="GramE">looking</span>
this way<br>
and that way, and seemed quite bewildered. Presently she made her way up<br>
to Jerry and asked if he could tell her the way to St. Thomas' Hospital,<br>
and how far it was to get there. She had come from the country that<br>
morning, she said, in a market cart; she did not know about the<br>
<span class="GramE">election, and</span> was quite a stranger in London. She had
got an order for<br>
the hospital for her little boy. The child was crying with a feeble,<br>
pining cry.<br>
<br>
"Poor little fellow!" she said, "he suffers a deal of pain; he
is four<br>
years old and can't walk any more than a baby; but the doctor said if I<br>
could get him into the hospital he might get well; pray, sir, how far is<br>
it; and which way is it?"<br>
<br>
"Why, missis," said Jerry, "you can't get there walking through
crowds<br>
like this! why, it is three miles away, and that child is heavy."<br>
<br>
"Yes, bless him, he is; but I am strong, thank God, and if I knew the<br>
way I think I should get on somehow; please tell me the way."<br>
<br>
"You can't do it," said Jerry, "you might be knocked down and
the child<br>
be run over. Now look here, just get into this cab, and I'll drive you<br>
safe to the hospital. Don't you see the rain is coming on?"<br>
<br>
"No, sir, no; I can't do that, thank you, I have only just money enough<br>
to get back with. Please tell me the way."<br>
<br>
"Look you here, missis," said Jerry, "I've got a wife and dear
children<br>
at home, and I know a father's feelings; now get you into that cab, and<br>
I'll take you there for nothing. I'd be ashamed of myself to let a woman<br>
and a sick child run a risk like that."<br>
<br>
"Heaven bless you!" said the woman, and burst into tears.<br>
<br>
"There, there, cheer up, my dear, I'll soon take you there; come, let me<br>
put you inside."<br>
<br>
As Jerry went to open the door two men, with colors in their hats and<br>
buttonholes, ran up calling out, "Cab!"<br>
<br>
"Engaged," cried Jerry; but one of the men, pushing past the woman,<br>
sprang into the cab, followed by the other. Jerry looked as stern as a<br>
policeman. "This cab is already engaged, gentlemen, by that lady."<br>
<br>
"Lady!" said one of them; "oh! she can wait; our business is
very<br>
important, besides we were in first, it is our right, and we shall stay<br>
in."<br>
<br>
A droll smile came over Jerry's face as he shut the door upon them. "All<br>
right, gentlemen, pray stay in as long as it suits you; I can wait while<br>
you rest yourselves." And turning his back upon them he walked up to the<br>
young woman, who was standing near me. "They'll soon be gone," he
said,<br>
laughing; "don't trouble yourself, my dear."<br>
<br>
And they soon were gone, for when they understood Jerry's <span class="GramE">dodge</span>
they got<br>
out, calling him all sorts of bad names and blustering about his number<br>
and getting a summons. After this little stoppage we were soon on our<br>
way to the hospital, going as much as possible through by-streets. Jerry<br>
rung the great bell and helped the young woman out.<br>
<br>
"Thank you a thousand times," she said; "I could never have got
here<br>
alone."<br>
<br>
"You're kindly welcome, and I hope the dear child will soon be
better."<br>
<br>
He watched her go in at the door, and gently he said to himself,<br>
"Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these." Then he<br>
patted my neck, which was always his way when anything pleased him.<br>
<br>
The rain was now coming down fast, and just as we were leaving the<br>
hospital the door opened again, and the porter called out, "Cab!" We<br>
stopped, and a lady came down the steps. Jerry seemed to know her at<br>
once; she put back her veil and said, "Barker! Jeremiah Barker, is it<br>
you? I am very glad to find you here; you are just the friend I want,<br>
for it is very difficult to get a cab in this part of London to-day."<br>
<br>
"I shall be proud to serve you, ma'am; I am right glad I happened to be<br>
here. Where may I take you to, ma'am?"<br>
<br>
"To the Paddington Station, and then if we are in good time, as I think<br>
we shall be, you shall tell me all about Mary and the children."<br>
<br>
We got to the station in good <span class="GramE">time, and</span> being under
shelter the lady<br>
stood a good while talking to Jerry. I found she had been Polly's<br>
mistress, and after many inquiries about her she said:<br>
<br>
"How do you find the cab work suit you in winter? I know Mary was rather<br>
anxious about you last year."<br>
<br>
"Yes, ma'am, she <span class="GramE">was;</span> I had a bad cough that
followed me up quite into<br>
the warm weather, and when I am kept out late she does worry herself a<br>
good deal. You see, ma'am, it is all hours and all weathers, and that<br>
does try a man's constitution; but I am getting on <span class="GramE">pretty
well</span>, and I<br>
should feel quite lost if I had not horses to look after. I was brought<br>
up to it, and I am afraid I should not do so well at anything else."<br>
<br>
"Well, Barker," she said, "it would be a great pity that you
should<br>
seriously risk your health in this work, not only for your own but for<br>
Mary's and the children's sake; there are many places where good drivers<br>
or good grooms are wanted, and if ever you think you ought to give up<br>
this cab work let me know."<br>
<br>
Then sending some kind messages to Mary she put something into his hand,<br>
saying, "There is five shillings each for the two children; Mary will<br>
know how to spend it."<br>
<br>
Jerry thanked her and seemed much pleased, and turning out of the<br>
station we at last reached home, and I, at least, was tired.<br>

    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<p><br>
Captain and I were great friends. He was a noble old fellow, and he was<br>
very good company. I never thought that he would have to leave his home<br>
and go down the hill; but his turn came, and this was how it happened. I<br>
was not there, but I heard all about it.<br>
<br>
He and Jerry had taken a party to the great railway station over London<br>
Bridge, and were coming back, somewhere between the bridge and the<br>
monument, when Jerry saw a brewer's empty dray coming along, drawn by<br>
two powerful horses. The drayman was lashing his horses with his heavy<br>
whip; the dray was light, and they started off at a furious rate; the<br>
man had no control over them, and the street was full of traffic.<br>
<br>
One young girl was knocked down and run over, and the next moment they<br>
dashed up against our cab; both the wheels were torn off and the cab was<br>
thrown over. Captain was dragged down, the shafts splintered, and one<br>
of them ran into his side. Jerry, too, was thrown, but was only bruised;<br>
nobody could tell how he escaped; he always said 'twas a miracle. When<br>
poor Captain was got up he was found to be very much cut and knocked<br>
about. Jerry led him home gently, and a sad sight it was to see the<br>
blood soaking into his white coat and dropping from his side and<br>
shoulder. The drayman was proved to be very drunk, and was fined, and<br>
the brewer had to pay damages to our master; but there was no one to pay<br>
damages to poor Captain.<br>
<br>
The farrier and Jerry did the best they could to ease his pain and make<br>
him comfortable. The fly had to be mended, and for several days I did<br>
not go out, and Jerry earned nothing. The first time we went to the<br>
stand after the accident the governor came up to hear how Captain was.<br>
<br>
"He'll never get over it," said Jerry, "at least not for my
work, so the<br>
farrier said this morning. He says he may do for carting, and that sort<br>
of work. It has put me out very much. Carting, indeed! I've seen what<br>
horses come to at that work round London. I only wish all the drunkards<br>
could be put in a lunatic asylum instead of being allowed to run foul of<br>
sober people. If they would break their own bones, and smash their own<br>
carts, and lame their own horses, that would be their own affair, and<br>
we might let them alone, but it seems to me that the innocent<br>
always suffer; and then they talk about compensation! You can't make<br>
compensation; there's all the trouble, and vexation, and loss of time,<br>
besides losing a good horse that's like an old friend--it's nonsense<br>
talking of compensation! If there's one devil that I should like to see<br>
in the bottomless pit more than another, it's the drink devil."<br>
<br>
"I say, Jerry," said the governor, "you are treading pretty hard
on my<br>
toes, you know; I'm not so good as you are, more shame to me; I wish I<br>
was."<br>
<br>
"Well," said Jerry, "why don't you cut with it, governor? You
are too<br>
good a man to be the slave of such a thing."<br>
<br>
"I'm a great fool, Jerry, but I tried once for two days, and I thought I<br>
should have died; how did you do?"<br>
<br>
"I had hard work at it for several weeks; you see I never did get drunk,<br>
but I found that I was not my own master, and that when the craving came<br>
on it was hard work to say 'no'. I saw that one of us must knock under,<br>
the drink devil or Jerry Barker, and I said that it should not be Jerry<br>
Barker, God helping me; but it was a struggle, and I wanted all the<br>
help I could get, for till I tried to break the habit I did not know how<br>
strong it was; but then Polly took such pains that I should have good<br>
food, and when the craving came on I used to get a cup of coffee, or<br>
some peppermint, or read a bit in my book, and that was a help to me;<br>
sometimes I had to say over and over to myself, 'Give up the drink or<br>
lose your soul! Give up the drink or break Polly's heart!' But thanks be<br>
to God, and my dear wife, my chains were broken, and now for ten years I<br>
have not tasted a drop, and never wish for it."<br>
<br>
"I've a great mind to try at it," said Grant, "for 'tis a poor
thing not<br>
to be one's own master."<br>
<br>
"Do, governor, do, you'll never repent it, and what a help it would be<br>
to some of the poor fellows in our rank if they saw you do without it. I<br>
know there's two or three would like to keep out of that tavern if they<br>
could."<br>
<br>
At first Captain seemed to do well, but he was a very old horse, and it<br>
was only his wonderful constitution, and Jerry's care, that had kept<br>
him up at the cab work so long; now he broke down very much. The farrier<br>
said he might mend up enough to sell for a few pounds, but Jerry said,<br>
no! a few pounds got by selling a good old servant into hard work<br>
and misery would canker all the rest of his money, and he thought the<br>
kindest thing he could do for the fine old fellow would be to put a sure<br>
bullet through his head, and then he would never suffer more; for he did<br>
not know where to find a kind master for the rest of his days.<br>
<br>
The day after this was decided Harry took me to the forge for some new<br>
shoes; when I returned Captain was gone. I and the family all felt it<br>
very much.<br>
<br>
Jerry had now to look out for another horse, and he soon heard of one<br>
through an acquaintance who was under-groom in a nobleman's stables. He<br>
was a valuable young horse, but he had run away, smashed into another<br>
carriage, flung his lordship out, and so cut and blemished himself that<br>
he was no longer fit for a gentleman's stables, and the coachman had<br>
orders to look round, and sell him as well as he could.<br>
<br>
"I can do with high spirits," said Jerry, "if a horse is not
vicious or<br>
hard-mouthed."<br>
<br>
"There is not a bit of vice in him," said the man; "his mouth is
very<br>
tender, and I think myself that was the cause of the accident; you see<br>
he had just been clipped, and the weather was bad, and he had not had<br>
exercise enough, and when he did go out he was as full of spring as a<br>
balloon. Our governor (the coachman, I mean) had him harnessed in as<br>
tight and strong as he could, with the martingale, and the <span class="GramE">check-rein</span>,
a<br>
very sharp curb, and the reins put in at the bottom bar. It is my belief<br>
that it made the horse mad, being tender in the mouth and so full of<br>
spirit."<br>
<br>
"Likely enough; I'll come and see him," said Jerry.<br>
<br>
The next day Hotspur, that was his name, came home; he was a fine brown<br>
horse, without a white hair in him, as tall as Captain, with a very<br>
handsome head, and only five years old. I gave him a friendly greeting<br>
by way of good <span class="GramE">fellowship, but</span> did not ask him any
questions. The first<br>
night he was very restless. Instead of lying down, he kept jerking his<br>
halter rope up and down through the <span class="GramE">ring, and</span> knocking
the block about<br>
against the manger till I could not sleep. However, the next day, after<br>
five or six hours in the cab, he came in quiet and sensible. Jerry<br>
patted and talked to him a good deal, and very soon they understood each<br>
other, and Jerry said that with an easy bit and plenty of work he would<br>
be as gentle as a lamb; and that it was an ill wind that blew nobody<br>
good, for if his lordship had lost a hundred-guinea favorite, the cabman<br>
had gained a good horse with all his strength in him.<br>
<br>
Hotspur thought it a great come-down to be a cab-horse, and was<br>
disgusted at standing in the rank, but he confessed to me at the end of<br>
the week that an easy mouth and a free head made up for a great deal,<br>
and after all, the work was not so degrading as having one's head and<br>
tail fastened to each other at the saddle. In fact, he settled in well,<br>
and Jerry liked him very much.<br>

        <p>1. Captain got injured when a drunk drayman's horses ran into the cab that Jerry and Captain were driving. The cab was overturned, and Captain was badly cut and knocked about. Jerry had to decide whether to sell Captain, who was no longer fit for cab work, or put him down to end his suffering. Jerry chose not to sell Captain into hard work and misery and decided to put him down to spare him further pain.</p>
        <p>2. Jerry decided to stop drinking because he realized that the craving for alcohol was making him lose control, and he did not want to be enslaved by the "drink devil." His wife, Polly, played a crucial role in helping him overcome the habit by providing good food, offering alternatives like coffee and peppermint when cravings struck, and providing emotional support. Jerry also motivated himself by repeating thoughts like "Give up the drink or lose your soul!" and "Give up the drink or break Polly's heart!" With determination and the support of his wife, Jerry successfully broke the habit and did not consume alcohol for ten years.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Chapter 45. Jerry's New Year</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<p><br>
For some people Christmas and the New Year are very merry times; but for<br>
cabmen and cabmen's horses it is no holiday, though it may be a harvest.<br>
There are so many parties, balls, and places of amusement open that the<br>
work is hard and often late. Sometimes driver and horse <span class="GramE">have
to</span> wait<br>
for hours in the rain or frost, shivering with the cold, while the merry<br>
people within are dancing away to the music. I wonder if the beautiful<br>
ladies ever think of the weary cabman waiting on his box, and his<br>
patient beast standing, till his legs get stiff with cold.<br>
<br>
I had now most of the evening work, as I was well accustomed to<br>
standing, and Jerry was also more afraid of Hotspur taking cold. We had<br>
a great deal of late work in the Christmas week, and Jerry's cough was<br>
bad; but however late we were, Polly sat up for him, and came out with a<br>
lantern to meet him, looking anxious and troubled.<br>
<br>
On the evening of the New Year we had to take two gentlemen to a house<br>
in one of the West End Squares. We set them down at nine o'clock, and<br>
were told to come again at eleven, "but," said one, "as it is a
card<br>
party, you may have to wait a few minutes, but don't be late."<br>
<br>
As the clock struck <span class="GramE">eleven</span> we were at the door, for
Jerry was always<br>
punctual. The clock chimed the quarters, one, two, three, and then<br>
struck twelve, but the door did not open.<br>
<br>
The wind had been very changeable, with squalls of rain during the day,<br>
but now it came on sharp, driving sleet, which seemed to come all the<br>
way round; it was very cold, and there was no shelter. Jerry got off<br>
his box and came and pulled one of my cloths a little more over my neck;<br>
then he took a turn or two up and down, stamping his feet; then he began<br>
to beat his arms, but that set him off coughing; so he opened the cab<br>
door and sat at the bottom with his feet on the pavement, and was a<br>
little sheltered. Still the clock chimed the quarters, and no one came.<br>
At half-past twelve he rang the bell and asked the servant if he would<br>
be wanted that night.<br>
<br>
"Oh, yes, you'll be wanted safe enough," said the man; "you must
not go,<br>
it will soon be over," and again Jerry sat down, but his voice was so<br>
hoarse I could hardly hear him.<br>
<br>
At a quarter past one the door opened, and the two gentlemen came out;<br>
they got into the cab without a word, and told Jerry where to drive,<br>
that was nearly two miles. My legs were numb with cold, and I thought<br>
I should have stumbled. When the men got out they never said they were<br>
sorry to have kept us waiting so long, but were angry at the charge;<br>
however, as Jerry never charged more than was his due, so he never took<br>
less, and they had to pay for the two hours and a quarter waiting; but<br>
it was hard-earned money to Jerry.<br>
<br>
At last we got home; he could hardly speak, and his cough was dreadful.<br>
Polly asked no questions, but opened the door and held the lantern for<br>
him.<br>
<br>
"Can't I do something?" she said.<br>
<br>
"Yes; get Jack something warm, and then boil me some gruel."<br>
<br>
This was said in a hoarse whisper; he could hardly get his breath, but<br>
he gave me a rub-down as usual, and even went up into the hayloft for an<br>
extra bundle of straw for my bed. Polly brought me a warm mash that made<br>
me comfortable, and then they locked the door.<br>
<br>
It was late the next morning before <span class="GramE">any one</span> came, and
then it was only<br>
Harry. He cleaned us and fed us, and swept out the stalls, then he put<br>
the straw back again as if it was Sunday. He was very still, and neither<br>
whistled nor sang. At noon he came again and gave us our food and water;<br>
this time Dolly came with him; she was crying, and I could gather from<br>
what they said that Jerry was dangerously ill, and the doctor said it<br>
was a bad case. <span class="GramE">So</span> two days passed, and there was
great trouble indoors.<br>
We only saw Harry, and sometimes Dolly. I think she came for company,<br>
for Polly was always with Jerry, and he had to be kept very quiet.<br>
<br>
On the third day, while Harry was in the stable, a tap came at the door,<br>
and Governor Grant came in.<br>
<br>
"I wouldn't go to the house, my boy," he said, "but I want to
know how<br>
your father is."<br>
<br>
"He is very bad," said Harry, "he can't be much worse; they call<br>
it 'bronchitis'; the doctor thinks it will turn one way or another<br>
to-night."<br>
<br>
"That's bad, very bad," said Grant, shaking his head; "I know
two men<br>
who died of that last week; it takes 'em off in no time; but while<br>
there's life there's hope, so you must keep up your spirits."<br>
<br>
"Yes," said Harry quickly, "and the doctor said that father had
a better<br>
chance than most men, because he didn't drink. He said yesterday the<br>
fever was so high that if father had been a drinking man it would have<br>
burned him up like a piece of paper; but I believe he thinks he will get<br>
over it; don't you think he will, Mr. Grant?"<br>
<br>
The governor looked puzzled.<br>
<br>
"If there's any rule that good men should get over these things, I'm<br>
sure he will, my boy; he's the best man I know. I'll look in early<br>
to-morrow."<br>
<br>
Early next morning he was there.<br>
<br>
"Well?" said he.<br>
<br>
"Father is better," said Harry. "Mother hopes he will get over
it."<br>
<br>
"Thank God!" said the governor, "and now you must keep him warm,
and<br>
keep his mind easy, and that brings me to the horses; you see Jack will<br>
be all the better for the rest of a week or two in a warm stable, and<br>
you can easily take him a turn up and down the street to stretch his<br>
legs; but this young one, if he does not get work, he will soon be all<br>
up on end, as you may say, and will be rather too much for you; and when<br>
he does go out there'll be an accident."<br>
<br>
"It is like that now," said Harry. "I have kept him short of
corn, but<br>
he's so full of spirit I don't know what to do with him."<br>
<br>
"Just so," said Grant. "Now look here, will you tell your mother
that<br>
if she is <span class="GramE">agreeable</span> I will come for him every day till
something is<br>
arranged, and take him for a good spell of work, and whatever he earns,<br>
I'll bring your mother half of it, and that will help with the horses'<br>
feed. Your father is in a good club, I know, but that won't keep the<br>
horses, and they'll be eating their heads off all this time; I'll come<br>
at noon and hear what she says," and without waiting for Harry's thanks<br>
he was gone.<br>
<br>
At noon I think he went and saw Polly, for he and Harry came to the<br>
stable together, harnessed Hotspur, and took him out.<br>
<br>
For a week or more he came for Hotspur, and when Harry thanked him or<br>
said anything about his kindness, he laughed it off, saying it was all<br>
good luck for him, for his horses were wanting a little rest which they<br>
would not otherwise have had.<br>
<br>
Jerry grew better steadily, but the doctor said that he must never go<br>
back to the cab work again if he wished to be an old man. The children<br>
had many consultations together about what father and mother would do,<br>
and how they could help to earn money.<br>
<br>
One afternoon Hotspur was brought in very wet and dirty.<br>
<br>
"The streets are nothing but slush," said the governor; "it will
give<br>
you a good warming, my boy, to get him clean and dry."<br>
<br>
"All right, governor," said Harry, "I shall not leave him till
he is;<br>
you know I have been trained by my father."<br>
<br>
"I wish all the boys had been trained like you," said the governor.<br>
<br>
While Harry was sponging off the mud from Hotspur's body and legs Dolly<br>
came in, looking very full of something.<br>
<br>
"Who lives at Fairstowe, Harry? Mother has got a letter from Fairstowe;<br>
she seemed so <span class="GramE">glad, and</span> ran upstairs to father with
it."<br>
<br>
"Don't you know? Why, it is the name of Mrs. Fowler's place--mother's<br>
old mistress, you know--the lady that father met last summer, who sent<br>
you and me five shillings each."<br>
<br>
"Oh! Mrs. Fowler. Of course, I know all about her. I wonder what she is<br>
writing to mother about."<br>
<br>
"Mother wrote to her last week," said Harry; "you know she told
father<br>
if ever he gave up the cab <span class="GramE">work</span> she would like to
know. I wonder what<br>
she <span class="GramE">says;</span> run in and see, Dolly."<br>
<br>
Harry scrubbed away at Hotspur with a huish! huish! like any old<br>
hostler. In a few minutes Dolly came dancing into the stable.<br>
<br>
"Oh! <span class="GramE">Harry,</span> there never was anything so
beautiful; Mrs. Fowler says we<br>
are all to go and live near her. There is a cottage now empty that<br>
will just suit us, with a garden and a henhouse, and apple-trees, and<br>
everything! and her coachman is going away in the spring, and then she<br>
will want father in his place; and there are good families round, where<br>
you can get a place in the garden or the stable, or as a page-boy;<br>
and there's a good school for me; and mother is laughing and crying by<br>
turns, and father does look so happy!"<br>
<br>
"That's uncommon jolly," said Harry, "and just the right thing,
I should<br>
say; it will suit father and mother both; but I don't intend to be a<br>
page-boy with tight clothes and rows of buttons. I'll be a groom or a<br>
gardener."<br>
<br>
It was quickly settled that as soon as Jerry was well <span class="GramE">enough</span>
they should<br>
remove to the country, and that the cab and horses should be sold as<br>
soon as possible.<br>
<br>
This was heavy news for me, for I was not young now, and could not look<br>
for any improvement in my condition. Since I left Birtwick I had never<br>
been so happy as with my dear master Jerry; but three years of cab work,<br>
even under the best conditions, will tell on one's strength, and I felt<br>
that I was not the horse that I had been.<br>
<br>
Grant said at once that he would take Hotspur, and there were men on the<br>
stand who would have bought me; but Jerry said I should not go to cab<br>
work again with just anybody, and the governor promised to find a place<br>
for me where I should be comfortable.<br>
<br>
The day came for going away. Jerry had not been allowed to go out yet,<br>
and I never saw him after that <span class="GramE">New Year's eve</span>. Polly
and the children<br>
came to bid me good-by. "Poor old Jack! dear old Jack! I wish we could<br>
take you with us," she said, and then laying her hand on my mane she put<br>
her face close to my neck and kissed me. Dolly was crying and kissed<br>
me too. Harry stroked me a great deal, but said nothing, only he seemed<br>
very sad, and so I was led away to my new place.<br>

        <p>1. Christmas and the New Year were not holidays for cabmen and cab horses because there were many parties, balls, and places of amusement open, leading to hard and late work. Cab drivers and their horses often had to wait for hours in harsh weather conditions while the passengers enjoyed the festivities.</p>
        <p>2. Dolly brought the news that Mrs. Fowler, Polly's old mistress, wanted the family to live near her. There was a cottage available with a garden, henhouse, and other amenities. Mrs. Fowler's coachman was leaving, and she wanted Jerry to take his place. The family would have opportunities for work and schooling, and this news made the family very happy. They decided to move to the country as soon as Jerry was well enough, and the cab and horses would be sold.</p>
