    <p class="w3-large"><strong>CHAPTER 6. Liberty</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
I was quite happy in my new place, and if there was one thing that I<br>
missed it must not be thought I was discontented; all who had to do with<br>
me were good and I had a light airy stable and the best of food. What<br>
more could I want? Why, liberty! For three years and a half of my life<br>
I had had all the liberty I could wish for; but now, week after week,<br>
month after month, and no doubt year after year, I must stand up in a<br>
stable night and day except when I am wanted, and then I must be just<br>
as steady and quiet as any old horse who has worked twenty years. Straps<br>
here and straps there, a bit in my mouth, and blinkers over my eyes.<br>
Now, I am not complaining, for I know it must be so. I only mean to say<br>
that for a young horse full of strength and spirits, who has been used<br>
to some large field or plain where he can fling up his head and toss up<br>
his tail and gallop away at full speed, then round and back again with<br>
a snort to his companions--I say it is hard never to have a bit more<br>
liberty to do as you like. Sometimes, when I have had less exercise than<br>
usual, I have felt so full of life and spring that when John has taken<br>
me out to exercise I really could not keep quiet; do what I would, it<br>
seemed as if I must jump, or dance, or prance, and many a good shake I<br>
know I must have given him, especially at the first; but he was always<br>
good and patient.<br>
<br>
"Steady, steady, my boy," he would say; "wait a bit, and we will
have a<br>
good swing, and soon get the tickle out of your feet." Then as soon as<br>
we were out of the village, he would give me a few miles at a spanking<br>
trot, and then bring me back as fresh as before, only clear of the<br>
fidgets, as he called them. Spirited horses, when not enough exercised,<br>
are often called skittish, when it is only play; and some grooms will<br>
punish them, but our John did not; he knew it was only high spirits.<br>
Still, he had his own ways of making me understand by the tone of<br>
his voice or the touch of the rein. If he was very serious and quite<br>
determined, I always knew it by his voice, and that had more power with<br>
me than anything else, for I was very fond of him.<br>
<br>
I ought to say that sometimes we had our liberty for a few hours; this<br>
used to be on fine Sundays in the <span class="GramE">summer-time</span>. The
carriage never went<br>
out on Sundays, because the church was not far off.<br>
<br>
It was a great treat to us to be turned out into the home paddock or<br>
the old orchard; the grass was so cool and soft to our feet, the air so<br>
sweet, and the freedom to do as we liked was so pleasant--to gallop, to<br>
lie down, and roll over on our backs, or to nibble the sweet grass.<br>
Then it was a very good time for talking, as we stood together under the<br>
shade of the large chestnut tree.<br>

He mentions that he's not complaining because he understands that, in his current situation, being confined to a stable is necessary.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>CHAPTER 7. Ginger</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
One day when Ginger and I were standing alone in the shade, we had a<br>
great deal of talk; she wanted to know all about my bringing up and<br>
breaking in, and I told her.<br>
<br>
"Well," said she, "if I had had your bringing up I might have
had as<br>
good a temper as you, but now I don't believe I ever shall."<br>
<br>
"Why not?" I said.<br>
<br>
"Because it has been all so different with me," she replied. "I
never<br>
had <span class="GramE">any one</span>, horse or man, that was kind to me, or
that I cared to<br>
please, for in the first place I was taken from my mother as soon as I<br>
was weaned, and put with a lot of other young colts; none of them cared<br>
for me, and I cared for none of them. There was no kind master like<br>
yours to look after me, and talk to me, and bring me nice things to eat.<br>
The man that had the care of us never gave me a kind word in my life.<br>
I do not mean that he ill-used me, but he did not care for us one<br>
bit further than to see that we had plenty to eat, and shelter in the<br>
winter. A footpath ran through our field, and very often the great boys<br>
passing through would fling stones to make us gallop. I was never hit,<br>
but one fine young colt was badly cut in the face, and I should think<br>
it would be a scar for life. We did not care for them, but of course<br>
it made us <span class="GramE">more wild</span>, and we settled it in our minds
that boys were our<br>
enemies. We had very good fun in the free meadows, galloping up and down<br>
and chasing each other round and round the field; then standing still<br>
under the shade of the trees. But when it came to breaking in, that was<br>
a bad time for me; several men came to catch me, and when at last they<br>
closed me in at one corner of the field, one caught me by the forelock,<br>
another caught me by the nose and held it so tight I could hardly draw<br>
my breath; then another took my under jaw in his hard hand and wrenched<br>
my mouth open, and so by force they got on the halter and the bar into<br>
my mouth; then one dragged me along by the halter, another flogging<br>
behind, and this was the first experience I had of men's kindness; it<br>
was all force. They did not give me a chance to know what they wanted.<br>
I was high bred and had a great deal of spirit, and was very wild, no<br>
doubt, and gave them, I dare say, plenty of trouble, but then it was<br>
dreadful to be shut up in a stall day after day instead of having my<br>
liberty, and I fretted and pined and wanted to get loose. You know<br>
yourself it's bad enough when you have a kind master and plenty of<br>
coaxing, but there was nothing of that sort for me.<br>
<br>
"There was one--the old master, Mr. Ryder--who, I think, could soon have<br>
brought me round, and could have done anything with me; but he had given<br>
up all the hard part of the trade to his son and to another experienced<br>
man, and he only came at times to oversee. His son was a strong, tall,<br>
bold man; they called him Samson, and he used to boast that he had never<br>
found a horse that could throw him. There was no gentleness in him, as<br>
there was in his father, but only hardness, a hard voice, a hard eye, a<br>
hard hand; and I felt from the first that what he wanted was to wear all<br>
the spirit out of me, and just make me into a quiet, humble, obedient<br>
piece of horseflesh. 'Horseflesh'! Yes, that is all that he thought<br>
about," and Ginger stamped her foot as if the very thought of him made<br>
her angry. Then she went on:<br>
<br>
"If I did not do exactly what he wanted he would get put <span class="GramE">out, and</span> make<br>
me run round with that long rein in the training field till he had<br>
tired me out. I think he drank a good deal, and I am quite sure that the<br>
oftener he drank the worse it was for me. One day he had worked me hard<br>
in every way he could, and when I lay <span class="GramE">down</span> I was
tired, and miserable,<br>
and angry; it all seemed so hard. The next <span class="GramE">morning</span> he
came for me early,<br>
and ran me round again for a long time. I had scarcely had an hour's<br>
<span class="GramE">rest, when</span> he came again for me with a saddle and
bridle and a new kind<br>
of bit. I could never quite tell how it came about; he had only just<br>
mounted me on the training ground, when something I did put him out<br>
of temper, and he chucked me hard with the rein. The new bit was very<br>
painful, and I reared up suddenly, which angered him still more, and he<br>
began to flog me. I felt my whole spirit set against him, and I began<br>
to kick, and plunge, and rear as I had never done before, and we had a<br>
regular fight; for a long time he stuck to the saddle and punished me<br>
cruelly with his whip and spurs, but my blood was thoroughly up, and I<br>
cared for nothing he could do if only I could get him off. At <span class="GramE">last</span> after<br>
a terrible struggle I threw him off backward. I heard him fall heavily<br>
on the turf, and without looking behind me, I galloped off to the other<br>
end of the field; there I turned round and saw my persecutor slowly<br>
rising from the ground and going into the stable. I stood under an oak<br>
tree and watched, but no one came to catch me. The time went on, and the<br>
sun was very hot; the flies swarmed round me and settled on my bleeding<br>
flanks where the spurs had dug in. I felt hungry, for I had not eaten<br>
since the early morning, but there was not enough grass in that meadow<br>
for a goose to live on. I wanted to lie down and rest, but with the<br>
saddle strapped tightly on there was no comfort, and there was not a<br>
drop of water to drink. The afternoon wore on, and the sun got low. I<br>
saw the other colts led in, and I knew they were having a good feed.<br>
<br>
"At last, just as the sun went down, I saw the old master come out with<br>
a sieve in his hand. He was a very fine old gentleman with quite white<br>
hair, but his voice was what I should know him by among a thousand. It<br>
was not high, nor yet low, but full, and clear, and kind, and when<br>
he gave <span class="GramE">orders</span> it was so steady and decided that every
one knew, both<br>
horses and men, that he expected to be obeyed. He came quietly along,<br>
now and then shaking the oats about that he had in the sieve, and<br>
speaking cheerfully and gently to me: 'Come along, lassie, come along,<br>
lassie; come along, come along.' I stood still and let him come up; he<br>
held the oats to me, and I began to eat without fear; his voice took all<br>
my fear away. He stood by, <span class="GramE">patting</span> and stroking me
while I was eating,<br>
and seeing the clots of blood on my side he seemed very vexed. 'Poor<br>
lassie! it was a bad business, a bad business;' then he quietly took the<br>
rein and led me to the stable; just at the door stood Samson. I laid my<br>
ears back and snapped at him. 'Stand back,' said the master, 'and keep<br>
out of her way; you've done a bad day's work for this filly.' He growled<br>
out something about a vicious brute. 'Hark ye,' said the father, 'a<br>
bad-tempered man will never make a good-tempered horse. You've not<br>
learned your trade yet, Samson.' Then he led me into my box, took off<br>
the saddle and bridle with his own hands, and tied me up; then he called<br>
for a pail of warm water and a sponge, took off his coat, and while the<br>
stable-man held the pail, he sponged my sides a good while, so tenderly<br>
that I was sure he knew how sore and bruised they were. 'Whoa! my pretty<br>
one,' he said, 'stand still, stand still.' His very voice did me good,<br>
and the bathing was very comfortable. The skin was so broken at the<br>
corners of my mouth that I could not eat the hay, the stalks hurt me. He<br>
looked closely at it, shook his head, and told the man to fetch a good<br>
bran mash and put some meal into it. How good that mash was! and so soft<br>
and healing to my mouth. He stood by all the time I was eating, stroking<br>
me and talking to the man. 'If a high-mettled creature like this,'<br>
said he, 'can't be broken by fair means, she will never be good for<br>
anything.'<br>
<br>
"After that he often came to see me, and when my mouth was healed the<br>
other breaker, Job, they called him, went on training me; he was steady<br>
and thoughtful, and I soon learned what he wanted."<br>

        <p>1. Ginger believes she will never have a good temper because she had a difficult early life. She was taken from her mother early, put with other colts who didn't care for her, and had no kind master. The man in charge of them didn't give her a kind word, and she had negative experiences like being chased by boys throwing stones.</p>
        <p>2. When Ginger was being broken in by Samson, something she did put him out of temper, and he responded by harshly pulling on the rein and using a painful new bit. Ginger, feeling her spirit set against him, reared up, kicked, and had a fierce struggle with Samson. Eventually, she threw him off backward. The old master, Mr. Ryder, who could have handled her well, was disappointed in Samson's methods, calling it a bad day's work. He later treated Ginger's injuries with kindness, showing that gentleness and understanding were more effective in training horses.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>CHAPTER 8. Ginger's Story Continued</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
The next time that Ginger and I were together in the paddock she told me<br>
about her first place.<br>
<br>
"After my breaking in," she said, "I was bought by a dealer to
match<br>
another chestnut horse. For some weeks he drove us together, and then we<br>
were sold to a fashionable <span class="GramE">gentleman, and</span> were sent up
to London. I had<br>
been driven with a <span class="GramE">check-rein</span> by the dealer, and I
hated it worse<br>
than anything else; but in this place we were reined far tighter, the<br>
coachman and his master thinking we looked more stylish so. We were<br>
often driven about in the park and other fashionable places. You who<br>
never had a check-rein on don't know what it is, but I can tell you it<br>
is dreadful.<br>
<br>
"I like to toss my head about and hold it as high as any horse; but<br>
fancy now yourself, if you tossed your head up high and were obliged to<br>
hold it there, and that for hours together, not able to move it at all,<br>
except with a jerk still higher, your neck aching till you did not know<br>
how to bear it. Besides that, to have two bits instead of one--and mine<br>
was a sharp one, it hurt my tongue and my jaw, and the blood from my<br>
tongue colored the froth that kept flying from my lips as I chafed and<br>
fretted at the bits and rein. It was worst when we had to stand by the<br>
hour waiting for our mistress at some grand party or entertainment, and<br>
if I fretted or stamped with impatience the whip was laid on. It was<br>
enough to drive one mad."<br>
<br>
"Did not your master take any thought for you?" I said.<br>
<br>
"No," said she, "he only cared to have a stylish turnout, as
they<br>
call it; I think he knew very little about horses; he left that to his<br>
coachman, who told him I had an irritable temper! that I had not been<br>
well broken to the check-rein, but I should soon get used to it; but he<br>
was not the man to do it, for when I was in the stable, miserable and<br>
angry, instead of being smoothed and quieted by kindness, I got only a<br>
surly word or a blow. If he had been <span class="GramE">civil</span> I would
have tried to<br>
bear it. I was willing to work, and ready to work hard too; but to be<br>
tormented for nothing but their fancies angered me. What right had they<br>
to make me suffer like that? Besides the soreness in my mouth, and<br>
the pain in my neck, it always made my windpipe feel bad, and if I had<br>
stopped there long I know it would have spoiled my breathing; but I grew<br>
more and more restless and irritable, I could not help it; and I began<br>
to snap and kick when any one came to harness me; for this the groom<br>
beat me, and one day, as they had just buckled us into the carriage,<br>
and were straining my head up with that rein, I began to plunge and<br>
kick with all my might. I soon broke a lot of <span class="GramE">harness, and</span>
kicked myself<br>
clear; so that was an end of that place.<br>
<br>
"After this I was sent to Tattersall's to be sold; of course I could not<br>
be warranted free from vice, so nothing was said about that. My handsome<br>
appearance and good paces soon brought a gentleman to bid for me, and I<br>
was bought by another dealer; he tried me in all kinds of ways and with<br>
different bits, and he soon found out what I could not bear. At last<br>
he drove me quite without a check-rein, and then sold me as a perfectly<br>
quiet horse to a gentleman in the country; he was a good master, and I<br>
was getting on very well, but his old groom left him and a new one came.<br>
This man was as hard-tempered and hard-handed as Samson; he always spoke<br>
in a rough, impatient voice, and if I did not move in the stall the<br>
moment he wanted me, he would hit me above the hocks with his stable<br>
broom or the fork, whichever he might have in his hand. Everything he<br>
did was rough, and I began to hate him; he wanted to make me afraid<br>
of him, but I was too high-mettled for that, and one day when he had<br>
aggravated me more than usual I bit him, which of course put him in a<br>
great rage, and he began to hit me about the head with a riding whip.<br>
After that he never dared to come into my stall again; either my heels<br>
or my teeth were ready for him, and he knew it. I was quite quiet with<br>
my master, but of course he listened to what the man said, and so I was<br>
sold again.<br>
<br>
"The same dealer heard of me, and said he thought he knew one place<br>
where I should do well. ''Twas a pity,' he said, 'that such a fine horse<br>
should go to the bad, for want of a real good chance,' and the end of it<br>
was that I came here not long before you did; but I had then made up my<br>
mind that men were my natural enemies and that I must defend myself. Of<br>
course it is very different here, but who knows how long it will last? I<br>
wish I could think about things as you do; but I can't, after all I have<br>
gone through."<br>
<br>
"Well," I said, "I think it would be a real shame if you were to
bite or<br>
kick John or James."<br>
<br>
"I don't mean to," she said, "while they are good to me. I did
bite<br>
James once pretty sharp, but John said, 'Try her with kindness,' and<br>
instead of punishing me as I expected, James came to me with his arm<br>
bound up, and brought me a bran mash and stroked me; and I have never<br>
snapped at him since, and I won't either."<br>
<br>
I was sorry for Ginger, but of course I knew very little then, and I<br>
thought most likely she made the worst of it; however, I found that as<br>
the weeks went on she grew much more gentle and cheerful, and had lost<br>
the watchful, defiant look that she used to turn on any strange person<br>
who came near her; and one day James said, "I do believe that mare is<br>
getting fond of me, she quite whinnied after me this morning when I had<br>
been rubbing her forehead."<br>
<br>
"Ay, ay, Jim, 'tis 'the Birtwick balls'," said John, "she'll be
as good<br>
as Black Beauty by and by; kindness is all the physic she wants, poor<br>
thing!" Master noticed the change, too, and one day when he got out of<br>
the carriage and came to speak to us, as he often did, he stroked her<br>
beautiful neck. "Well, my pretty one, well, how do things go with you<br>
now? You are a good bit happier than when you came to us, I think."<br>
<br>
She put her nose up to him in a friendly, trustful way, while he rubbed<br>
it gently.<br>
<br>
"We shall make a cure of her, John," he said.<br>
<br>
"Yes, sir, she's wonderfully improved; she's not the same creature that<br>
she was; it's 'the Birtwick balls', sir," said John, laughing.<br>
<br>
This was a little joke of John's; he used to say that a regular course<br>
of "the Birtwick horseballs" would cure almost any vicious horse;
these<br>
balls, he said, were made up of patience and gentleness, firmness and<br>
petting, one pound of each to be mixed up with half a pint of common<br>
sense, and given to the horse every day.<br>

        <p>1. Ginger disliked the check-rein because it was used tightly, making her hold her head high for hours. She found it dreadful, causing her neck to ache, and the bits and rein hurt her mouth. When standing for a long time at parties or events, she would feel frustrated and impatient, leading to the use of the whip.</p>
        <p>2. After James treated Ginger with kindness, bringing her a bran mash and stroking her, she became more gentle and cheerful. Her watchful, defiant look disappeared. John noticed this positive change and humorously attributed it to "the Birtwick balls," referring to the kind treatment and care she received at Birtwick Hall.</p>

<br>
Mr. Blomefield, the vicar, had a large family of boys and girls;<br>
sometimes they used to come and play with Miss Jessie and Flora. One<br>
of the girls was as old as Miss Jessie; two of the boys were older, and<br>
there were several little ones. When they came there was plenty of work<br>
for Merrylegs, for nothing pleased them so much as getting on him by<br>
turns and riding him all about the orchard and the home paddock, and<br>
this they would do by the hour together.<br>
<br>
One afternoon he had been out with them a long time, and when James<br>
brought him in and put on his halter he said:<br>
<br>
"There, you rogue, mind how you behave yourself, or we shall get into<br>
trouble."<br>
<br>
"What have you been doing, Merrylegs?" I asked.<br>
<br>
"Oh!" said he, tossing his little head, "I have only been giving
those<br>
young people a lesson; they did not know when they had had enough, nor<br>
when I had had enough, so I just pitched them off backward; that was the<br>
only thing they could understand."<br>
<br>
"What!" said I, "you threw the children off? I thought you did
know<br>
better than that! Did you throw Miss Jessie or Miss Flora?"<br>
<br>
He looked very much offended, and said:<br>
<br>
"Of course not; I would not do such a thing for the best oats that ever<br>
came into the stable; why, I am as careful of our young ladies as the<br>
master could be, and as for the little ones it is I who teach them to<br>
ride. When they seem frightened or a little unsteady on my back I go as<br>
smooth and as quiet as old pussy when she is after a bird; and when they<br>
are all right I go on again faster, you see, just to use them to it; so<br>
don't you trouble yourself preaching to me; I am the best friend and the<br>
best riding-master those children have. It is not <span class="GramE">them,</span>
it is the boys;<br>
boys," said he, shaking his mane, "are quite different; they must be<br>
broken in as we were broken in when we were colts, and just be taught<br>
what's what. The other children had ridden me about for nearly two<br>
hours, and then the boys thought it was their turn, and so it was, and<br>
I was quite agreeable. They rode me by turns, and I galloped them about,<br>
up and down the fields and all about the orchard, for a good hour. They<br>
had each cut a great hazel stick for a riding-whip, and laid it on a<br>
little too hard; but I took it in good part, till at last I thought we<br>
had had enough, so I stopped two or three times by way of a hint.<br>
Boys, you see, think a horse or pony is like a steam-engine or a<br>
thrashing-machine, and can go on as long and as fast as they please;<br>
they never think that a pony can get tired, or have any feelings; so as<br>
the one who was whipping me could not understand I just rose up on<br>
my hind legs and let him slip off behind--that was all. He mounted me<br>
again, and I did the same. Then the other boy got up, and as soon as<br>
he began to use his stick I laid him on the grass, and so on, till they<br>
were able to understand--that was all. They are not bad boys; they don't<br>
wish to be cruel. I like them very well; but you see I had to give them<br>
a lesson. When they brought me to James and told him I think he was very<br>
angry to see such big sticks. He said they were only fit for drovers or<br>
gypsies, and not for young gentlemen."<br>
<br>
"If I had been you," said Ginger, "I would have given those boys
a good<br>
kick, and that would have given them a lesson."<br>
<br>
"No doubt you would," said Merrylegs; "but then I am not quite
such a<br>
fool (begging your pardon) as to anger our master or make James ashamed<br>
of me. Besides, those children are under my charge when they are riding;<br>
I tell you they are intrusted to me. Why, only the other day I heard our<br>
master say to Mrs. Blomefield, 'My dear madam, you need not be anxious<br>
about the children; my old Merrylegs will take as much care of them as<br>
you or I could; I assure you I would not sell that pony for any money,<br>
he is so perfectly good-tempered and trustworthy;' and do you think I am<br>
such an ungrateful brute as to forget all the kind treatment I have<br>
had here for five years, and all the trust they place in me, and turn<br>
vicious because a couple of ignorant boys used me badly? No, no! you<br>
never had a good place where they were kind to you, and so you don't<br>
know, and I'm sorry for you; but I can tell you good places make good<br>
horses. I wouldn't vex our people for anything; I love them, I do," said<br>
Merrylegs, and he gave a low "ho, ho, ho!" through his nose, as he
used<br>
to do in the morning when he heard James' footstep at the door.<br>
<br>
"Besides," he went on, "if I took to kicking where should I be?
Why,<br>
sold off in a jiffy, and no character, and I might find myself slaved<br>
about under a butcher's boy, or worked to death at some seaside place<br>
where no one cared for me, except to find out how fast I could go, or be<br>
flogged along in some cart with three or four great men in it going out<br>
for a Sunday spree, as I have often seen in the place I lived in before<br>
I came here; no," said he, shaking his head, "I hope I shall never
come<br>
to that."<br>

        <p>1. Merrylegs rose up on his hind legs and let one of the boys slip off behind him when they were riding him for almost two hours. He did this because the boys were using hazel sticks as riding-whips a little too hard, and he wanted to give them a lesson, signaling that they had ridden long enough.</p>
        <p>2. Merrylegs refused to kick or hurt the boys because he was grateful for the kind treatment he had received at the stable for five years. He emphasized that he loved the people at the stable, and they trusted him to take care of the children. He believed that kicking or turning vicious would jeopardize the trust and care he had received, and he wouldn't do anything to vex the people he loved.</p>

<br>
Ginger and I were not of the regular tall carriage horse breed, we had<br>
more of the racing blood in us. We stood about fifteen and a half hands<br>
high; we were therefore just as good for riding as we were for driving,<br>
and our master used to say that he disliked either horse or man that<br>
could do but one thing; and as he did not want to show off in London<br>
parks, he preferred a more active and useful kind of horse. As for us,<br>
our greatest pleasure was when we were saddled for a riding party; the<br>
master on Ginger, the mistress on me, and the young ladies on Sir Oliver<br>
and Merrylegs. It was so cheerful to be trotting and cantering all<br>
together that it always put us in high spirits. I had the best of it,<br>
for I always carried the mistress; her weight was little, her voice was<br>
sweet, and her hand was so light on the rein that I was guided almost<br>
without feeling it.<br>
<br>
Oh! if people knew what a comfort to horses a light hand is, and how it<br>
keeps a good mouth and a good temper, they surely would not chuck, and<br>
drag, and pull at the rein as they often do. Our mouths are so tender<br>
that where they have not been spoiled or hardened with bad or ignorant<br>
treatment, they feel the slightest movement of the driver's hand, and<br>
we know in an instant what is required of us. My mouth has never been<br>
spoiled, and I believe that was why the mistress preferred me to Ginger,<br>
although her paces were certainly quite as good. She used often to envy<br>
me, and said it was all the fault of breaking in, and the gag bit in<br>
London, that her mouth was not so perfect as mine; and then old Sir<br>
Oliver would say, "There, there! don't vex yourself; you have the<br>
greatest honor; a mare that can carry a tall man of our master's weight,<br>
with all your spring and sprightly action, does not need to hold her<br>
head down because she does not carry the lady; we horses must take<br>
things as they come, and always be contented and willing so long as we<br>
are kindly used."<br>
<br>
I had often wondered how it was that Sir Oliver had such a very short<br>
tail; it really was only six or seven inches long, with a tassel of hair<br>
hanging from it; and on one of our holidays in the orchard I ventured to<br>
ask him by what accident it was that he had lost his tail.
"Accident!"<br>
he snorted with a fierce look, "it was no accident! it was a cruel,<br>
shameful, cold-blooded act! When I was <span class="GramE">young</span> I was
taken to a place<br>
where these cruel things were done; I was tied up, and made fast so that<br>
I could not stir, and then they came and cut off my long and beautiful<br>
tail, through the flesh and through the bone, and took it away.<br>
<br>
"How dreadful!" I exclaimed.<br>
<br>
"Dreadful, ah! it was dreadful; but it was not only the pain, though<br>
that was terrible and lasted a long time; it was not only the indignity<br>
of having my best ornament taken from me, though that was bad; but it<br>
was this, how could I ever brush the flies off my sides and my hind legs<br>
any more? You who have tails just whisk the flies off without thinking<br>
about it, and you can't tell what a torment it is to have them settle<br>
upon you and sting and <span class="GramE">sting, and</span> have nothing in the
world to lash them<br>
off with. I tell you it is a lifelong wrong, and a lifelong loss; but<br>
thank heaven, they don't do it now."<br>
<br>
"What did they do it for then?" said Ginger.<br>
<br>
"For fashion!" said the old horse with a stamp of his foot; "for<br>
fashion! if you know what that means; there was not a well-bred young<br>
horse in my time that had not his tail docked in that shameful way, just<br>
as if the good God that made us did not know what we wanted and what<br>
looked best."<br>
<br>
"I suppose it is fashion that makes them strap our heads up with those<br>
horrid bits that I was tortured with in London," said Ginger.<br>
<br>
"Of course it is," said he; "to my mind, fashion is one of the
wickedest<br>
things in the world. Now look, for instance, at the way they serve dogs,<br>
cutting off their tails to make them look <span class="GramE">plucky, and</span>
shearing up their<br>
pretty little ears to a point to make them both look sharp, forsooth. I<br>
had a dear friend once, a brown terrier; 'Skye' they called her. She was<br>
so fond of me that she never would sleep out of my stall; she made<br>
her bed under the manger, and there she had a litter of five as pretty<br>
little puppies as need be; none were drowned, for they were a valuable<br>
kind, and how pleased she was with them! and when they got their eyes<br>
open and crawled about, it was a real pretty sight; but one day the man<br>
came and took them all away; I thought he might be afraid I should tread<br>
upon them. But it was not so; in the evening poor Skye brought them back<br>
again, one by one in her mouth; not the happy little things that they<br>
were, but bleeding and crying pitifully; they had all had a piece of<br>
their tails cut off, and the soft flap of their pretty little ears was<br>
cut quite off. How their mother licked them, and how troubled she was,<br>
poor thing! I never forgot it. They healed in time, and they forgot the<br>
pain, but the nice soft flap, that of course was intended to protect the<br>
delicate part of their ears from dust and injury, was gone forever. Why<br>
don't they cut their own children's ears into points to make them look<br>
sharp? Why don't they cut the end off their noses to make them look<br>
plucky? One would be just as sensible as the other. What right have they<br>
to torment and disfigure God's creatures?"<br>
<br>
Sir Oliver, though he was so gentle, was a fiery old fellow, and what<br>
he said was all so new to me, and so dreadful, that I found a bitter<br>
feeling toward men <span class="GramE">rise up</span> in my mind that I never had
before. <span class="GramE">Of course</span><br>
Ginger was very much excited; she flung up her head with flashing<br>
eyes and distended nostrils, declaring that men were both brutes and<br>
blockheads.<br>
<br>
"Who talks about blockheads?" said Merrylegs, who just came up from<br>
the old apple-tree, where he had been rubbing himself against the low<br>
branch. "Who talks about blockheads? I believe that is a bad word."<br>
<br>
"Bad words were made for bad things," said Ginger, and she told him
what<br>
Sir Oliver had said.<br>
<br>
"It is all true," said Merrylegs sadly, "and I've seen that
about the<br>
dogs over and over again where I lived first; but we won't talk about<br>
it here. You know that master, and John and James are always good to<br>
us, and talking against men in such a place as this doesn't seem fair<br>
or grateful, and you know there are good masters and good grooms beside<br>
ours, though of course ours are the best."<br>
<br>
This wise speech of good little Merrylegs, which we knew was quite true,<br>
cooled us all down, especially Sir Oliver, who was dearly fond of his<br>
master; and to turn the subject I said, "Can any one tell me the use of<br>
blinkers?"<br>
<br>
"No!" said Sir Oliver shortly, "because they are no use."<br>
<br>
"They are supposed," said Justice, the roan cob, in his calm way,
"to<br>
prevent horses from shying and starting, and getting so frightened as to<br>
cause accidents."<br>
<br>
"Then what is the reason they do not put them on riding horses;<br>
especially on ladies' horses?" said I.<br>
<br>
"There is no reason at all," said he quietly, "except the
fashion; they<br>
say that a horse would be so frightened to see the wheels of his own<br>
cart or carriage coming behind him that he would be sure to run away,<br>
although of course when he is ridden he sees them all about him if the<br>
streets are crowded. I admit they do sometimes come too close to be<br>
pleasant, but we don't run away; we are used to it, and understand it,<br>
and if we never had blinkers put on we should never want them; we should<br>
see what was there, and know what was what, and be much less frightened<br>
than by only seeing bits of things that we can't understand. Of course<br>
there may be some nervous horses who have been hurt or frightened when<br>
they were young, who may be the better for them; but as I never was<br>
nervous, I can't judge."<br>
<br>
"I consider," said Sir Oliver, "that blinkers are dangerous
things in<br>
the night; we horses can see much better in the dark than men can, and<br>
many an accident would never have happened if horses might have had the<br>
full use of their eyes. Some years ago, I remember, there was a hearse<br>
with two horses returning one dark night, and just by Farmer Sparrow's<br>
house, where the pond is close to the road, the wheels went too near the<br>
edge, and the hearse was overturned into the water; both the horses were<br>
drowned, and the driver hardly escaped. <span class="GramE">Of course</span>
after this accident<br>
a stout white rail was put up that might be easily seen, but if those<br>
horses had not been partly blinded, they would of themselves have kept<br>
further from the edge, and no accident would have happened. When our<br>
master's carriage was overturned, before you came here, it was said that<br>
if the lamp on the left side had not gone out, John would have seen the<br>
great hole that the road-makers had left; and so he might, but if old<br>
Colin had not had blinkers on he would have seen it, lamp or no lamp,<br>
for he was far too knowing an old horse to run into danger. As it was,<br>
he was very much hurt, the carriage was broken, and how John escaped<br>
nobody knew."<br>
<br>
"I should say," said Ginger, curling her nostril, "that these
men, who<br>
are so wise, had better give orders that in the future all foals should<br>
be born with their eyes set just in the middle of their foreheads,<br>
instead of on the side; they always think they can improve upon nature<br>
and mend what God has made."<br>
<br>
Things were getting rather sore again, when Merrylegs held up his<br>
knowing little face and said, "I'll tell you a secret: I believe John<br>
does not approve of blinkers; I heard him talking with master about it<br>
one day. The master said that 'if horses had been used to them, it might<br>
be dangerous in some cases to leave them off'; and John said he thought<br>
it would be a good thing if all colts were broken in without blinkers,<br>
as was the case in some foreign countries. So let us cheer up, and have<br>
a run to the other end of the orchard; I believe the wind has blown down<br>
some apples, and we might just as well eat them as the slugs."<br>
<br>
Merrylegs could not be resisted, so we broke off our long conversation,<br>
and got up our spirits by munching some very sweet apples which lay<br>
scattered on the grass.<br>
