        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds</strong> by David Goggins is a memoir and self-help book that chronicles the incredible journey of one of the world’s toughest individuals. Goggins, a former Navy SEAL, ultra-endurance athlete, and motivational speaker, shares his life story, filled with hardship, pain, and adversity. Throughout the book, Goggins discusses the concept of "mental toughness" and how anyone can push beyond their limits, face their fears, and overcome obstacles through the power of mindset and relentless perseverance. The book challenges the reader to confront their own limitations, embrace discomfort, and take control of their own destiny. Goggins’ message is clear: no matter how dire the circumstances, you are capable of achieving greatness if you are willing to endure and push yourself beyond what you thought possible.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Summary</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Can't Hurt Me</strong> is divided into chapters, each one telling a different part of Goggins’ life and the lessons he learned along the way. Each chapter is followed by a "Challenge," in which Goggins provides actionable steps to help readers apply the lessons he learned to their own lives.</p>

        <p><strong>Part One: The Early Struggles</strong></p>
        <p>In the first part of the book, Goggins recounts his traumatic childhood, growing up in an abusive and turbulent household. He faced racism, poverty, and neglect, and these early experiences had a profound effect on his self-esteem and mental health. Goggins also talks about his struggles with obesity and how he was determined to escape his past by joining the military. Despite his physical and emotional challenges, Goggins never gave up on his dream of becoming a Navy SEAL.</p>

        <p><strong>Part Two: The Navy SEAL Training</strong></p>
        <p>Goggins' time in Navy SEAL training is a central focus of the book. He describes the extreme physical and mental challenges he faced during Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training, where candidates undergo grueling physical tests and are pushed to their limits. Goggins’ story is one of mental resilience, as he pushed himself through extreme pain, injury, and exhaustion. He faced many failures along the way but was determined to finish. His perseverance and determination to "stay hard" in the face of adversity helped him become one of the toughest SEALs in history.</p>

        <p><strong>Part Three: Overcoming Adversity</strong></p>
        <p>Throughout the book, Goggins emphasizes that life is full of challenges, and the key to overcoming them is mental toughness. He shares his experiences of going through Hell Week, one of the most difficult aspects of Navy SEAL training, and how he learned to conquer his doubts and fear. Goggins reveals the mental techniques he used to push through pain and exhaustion, including focusing on his "cookie jar" of past victories and reminding himself of how far he had come. He highlights the importance of developing a "calloused mind" through repeated exposure to discomfort and adversity.</p>

        <p><strong>Part Four: Ultra-Endurance Races</strong></p>
        <p>After his time in the military, Goggins became an ultra-endurance athlete, participating in some of the world’s most grueling races. In this section, he details his journey through ultramarathons, including the famous Badwater Ultramarathon in Death Valley, where he ran 135 miles in extreme heat. Goggins discusses the physical and mental challenges of these events, and how they taught him to embrace discomfort and transcend his limits. He emphasizes the importance of embracing suffering and using it as a tool for personal growth.</p>

        <p><strong>Part Five: The Power of Accountability</strong></p>
        <p>In the final part of the book, Goggins talks about the importance of holding oneself accountable and embracing responsibility for one’s actions. He encourages readers to take ownership of their life and refuse to make excuses. He shares how accountability has been a key factor in his success, whether it’s in his military career, athletic pursuits, or personal growth. Goggins stresses that no one is coming to save you—you are the only one who can change your life.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Story</strong></p>
        <p>One of the most inspiring stories in the book is Goggins’ transformation from an overweight, self-doubting man into a Navy SEAL and ultra-endurance athlete. He describes how he was once rejected by the military three times due to his poor physical condition, and how he used this rejection as fuel to push himself harder. His story of running 100 miles in an ultra-endurance race with broken feet is a testament to the power of the human will and the idea that the mind can push the body far beyond what seems possible.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mental Toughness is Key:</strong> Goggins emphasizes that mental toughness is the most important factor in achieving success. The ability to push through discomfort, pain, and failure is what separates those who succeed from those who quit.</li>

            <li><strong>The Power of Accountability:</strong> Taking full responsibility for your actions and outcomes is essential for personal growth. No one can change your life except you.</li>
            <li><strong>Overcoming Self-Doubt:</strong> Goggins discusses how to deal with the self-doubt that often arises when pursuing difficult goals. He encourages readers to develop mental strategies to overcome fear and uncertainty.</li>

            <li><strong>The Cookie Jar:</strong> Goggins uses the "cookie jar" as a metaphor for the mental resource of past victories. When faced with difficult situations, he pulls from this mental jar of successes to remind himself of his strength and ability to persevere.</li>
