        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p><em>Drop Acid</em> by neurologist <strong>Dr. David Perlmutter</strong> introduces uric acid as a powerful but overlooked factor in metabolic and brain health. Published in 2022, the book reveals that elevated uric acid levels—not just fat, carbs, or calories—may be a root cause of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, fatty liver, and cognitive decline. Perlmutter offers a scientific yet accessible guide to understanding, measuring, and lowering uric acid to improve long-term health.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Summary</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Uric acid is more than gout:</strong> High levels can cause fat storage, insulin resistance, and inflammation.</li>
            <li><strong>Main culprits:</strong> Fructose, alcohol, purine-rich meats, dehydration, and poor kidney function.</li>
            <li><strong>How it harms:</strong> Disrupts mitochondrial energy, increases oxidative stress, and promotes brain aging.</li>
            <li><strong>Key framework:</strong> The LUV protocol – Lower intake, Urine test regularly, and Value uric acid as a health marker.</li>
            <li><strong>Includes:</strong> Food lists, supplement recommendations, recipes, and self-testing strategies.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Core Concept</strong></p>
        <p>The core message of <em>Drop Acid</em> is: <strong>Uric acid is a metabolic switch that contributes to obesity, chronic disease, and brain decline. Controlling it may be the key to reversing the modern health crisis.</strong></p>
        <p>By keeping uric acid below 5.5 mg/dL, you can improve energy, cognition, and metabolic function.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Key Insights and Strategies</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fructose is uniquely harmful:</strong> It drives uric acid production and liver fat accumulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Uric acid precedes disease:</strong> Levels rise years before diabetes or hypertension appear.</li>
            <li><strong>Evolutionary context:</strong> Our ancestors benefited from uric acid’s fat-storing effects; now it backfires.</li>
            <li><strong>Measure and monitor:</strong> Uric acid can be tracked via home tests or simple bloodwork.</li>
            <li><strong>Natural solutions:</strong> Vitamin C, quercetin, luteolin, hydration, and smart food swaps can help.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Quotes to Remember</strong></p>
        <blockquote>“Uric acid is more than a gout issue—it's a central player in metabolic dysfunction.”</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“We’ve been so focused on fat and sugar that we’ve missed a powerful trigger hiding in plain sight.”</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“Lowering uric acid may be the missing link in reversing metabolic disease.”</blockquote>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Practical Application</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eliminate high-fructose foods:</strong> Cut sugary drinks, fruit juice, and processed foods with corn syrup.</li>
            <li><strong>Limit purines:</strong> Reduce organ meats, beer, and excessive red meat intake.</li>
            <li><strong>Hydrate consistently:</strong> Support kidney function with plenty of water throughout the day.</li>
            <li><strong>Track uric acid:</strong> Use a uric acid blood monitor or ask for bloodwork; aim for < 5.5 mg/dL.</li>
            <li><strong>Use supportive supplements:</strong> Quercetin and vitamin C may naturally lower uric acid when taken properly.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Interesting Facts and Stories</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Uric acid was once lifesaving:</strong> It helped ancient humans store fat during times of famine.</li>
            <li><strong>Even “healthy” foods can spike it:</strong> Honey, agave, and dried fruits contain high fructose levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Brain effects are real:</strong> High uric acid is linked to fatigue, mental fog, and dementia risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Perlmutter practices what he preaches:</strong> After testing his own uric acid, he made changes and saw health improvements.</li>
            <li><strong>Drop Acid may redefine metabolic health:</strong> It introduces uric acid as a critical but underutilized biomarker.</li>
        </ul>
