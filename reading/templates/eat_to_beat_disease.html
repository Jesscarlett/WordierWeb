        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p>What if your body already had the power to fight disease—and food was the key to unlocking it? In <em>Eat to Beat Disease: The New Science of How Your Body Can Heal Itself</em>, physician and researcher <strong>Dr. William W. Li</strong> offers a science-backed guide to using food as medicine—not in the trendy or restrictive sense, but in a strategic, evidence-based way that activates your body’s own defense systems.</p>
        <p>Published in 2019, the book blends cutting-edge research with practical advice. Rather than promoting a specific diet, Li focuses on five health defense systems—angiogenesis, regeneration, microbiome, DNA protection, and immunity—and shows how specific foods can help enhance each one.</p>
        <p>This is not about eliminating foods. It’s about adding in the right ones to help your body resist illness, slow aging, and thrive.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Summary</strong></p>
        <p>Dr. Li organizes the book around five key defense systems in the human body:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Angiogenesis (Blood Vessel Growth):</strong> A healthy blood vessel network is crucial for supplying oxygen and nutrients. Some foods promote healthy angiogenesis (like green tea, tomatoes, and berries), while others—like sugar and ultra-processed meats—can fuel harmful blood vessel growth in tumors.</li>
            <li><strong>Regeneration (Stem Cells):</strong> The body has the ability to repair and regenerate through stem cells. Certain foods like dark chocolate, turmeric, and soybeans can activate regenerative pathways and support healing.</li>
            <li><strong>Microbiome (Gut Health):</strong> A diverse, balanced gut microbiome is essential for immunity, metabolism, and inflammation control. Fermented foods, fiber-rich veggies, and prebiotics help nourish good bacteria.</li>
            <li><strong>DNA Protection:</strong> Our DNA is under constant attack from environmental stress, pollution, and even natural aging. Foods rich in antioxidants—like blueberries, cruciferous vegetables, and green tea—can reduce DNA damage and even support repair mechanisms.</li>
            <li><strong>Immunity:</strong> Foods like mushrooms, garlic, and pomegranates help modulate and strengthen the immune system—making it more effective at fighting infections and recognizing abnormal cells like cancer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Li’s approach is flexible: no calorie counting, no one-size-fits-all plan. Instead, he offers an extensive list of more than 200 scientifically proven “health-activating” foods that readers can begin incorporating into any diet—whether omnivore, vegetarian, Mediterranean, or keto.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Core Concept</strong></p>
        <p>The central thesis is that <strong>the body is equipped with powerful self-healing systems, and food is a key to turning them on or off</strong>.</p>
        <p>Dr. Li shifts the focus from avoiding disease to proactively creating health. Rather than fear-based nutrition (cutting carbs, avoiding fats, etc.), his message is empowerment: eat more of the right foods and give your body what it needs to defend, repair, and regenerate.</p>
        <p>By aligning your diet with your biology, you not only reduce disease risk—you amplify vitality.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Key Insights and Strategies</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Food Is Medicine—Literally:</strong> Scientific studies show that certain foods outperform medications in reducing inflammation, reversing vascular damage, and supporting immunity.</li>
            <li><strong>You Don’t Need to Eat Perfectly:</strong> You can still enjoy coffee, dark chocolate, red wine, and even the occasional indulgence—as long as your overall food environment supports healing.</li>
            <li><strong>Angiogenesis Is a Game-Changer in Cancer Prevention:</strong> Li was one of the early researchers connecting poor angiogenesis to cancer growth. Eating foods that suppress abnormal vessel formation can help starve cancer before it takes hold.</li>
            <li><strong>The Microbiome Is a Force Multiplier:</strong> A well-fed gut flora enhances all other defense systems. The more fiber-rich, plant-diverse foods you eat, the more resilient your body becomes.</li>
            <li><strong>No One Diet Fits All:</strong> The best “diet” is one that is full of whole, unprocessed, disease-fighting foods that support your unique biology and preferences.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Quotes to Remember</strong></p>
        <blockquote>“Every bite of food you take is a chance to support your body’s health defenses.”</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“Food isn’t just fuel—it’s information. It tells your body what to do.”</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“Rather than wait for disease to happen, we can eat to beat it before it starts.”</blockquote>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Practical Application</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eat the rainbow</strong>—variety matters. Different colored fruits and vegetables offer distinct polyphenols and nutrients.</li>
            <li><strong>Include health defense foods daily</strong>—like berries, green tea, mushrooms, cruciferous vegetables, and whole grains.</li>
            <li><strong>Think add, not subtract</strong>—don’t obsess over cutting things out. Instead, crowd your plate with healing foods.</li>
            <li><strong>Drink smart</strong>—coffee, green tea, and even red wine (in moderation) can be part of a healing strategy.</li>
            <li><strong>Support your gut</strong>—eat prebiotic and probiotic foods like garlic, onions, bananas, yogurt, and kimchi.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You don’t have to overhaul your life overnight. Start by adding one healing food per meal and build from there.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Interesting Facts and Stories</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Li’s Research Helped Pioneer the Field of Angiogenesis in Cancer:</strong> He was part of the early team that discovered how tumor growth depends on hijacking blood vessels. This helped develop anti-angiogenic cancer therapies and inspired his search for foods that do the same.</li>
            <li><strong>Chocolate and Red Wine Are in the Book—for Real:</strong> Dr. Li includes both as “health-activating” foods. High-quality dark chocolate (at least 70%) has polyphenols that support circulation and regeneration.</li>
            <li><strong>He Tested Many Foods on Himself:</strong> Dr. Li personally experimented with incorporating these healing foods into his routine and measured the effects using blood biomarkers, gut sequencing, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>The Book Includes a “Food as Medicine” Appendix:</strong> With over 200 foods listed by function, this section is a go-to resource for readers who want a smart, flexible toolkit for better eating.</li>
