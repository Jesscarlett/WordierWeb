          <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Emotional Intelligence 2.0</strong> by Travis Bradberry and Jean Greaves provides practical strategies for improving emotional intelligence (EQ), a key skill for personal and professional success. Published in 2009, the book defines EQ as the ability to recognize, understand, and manage emotions in oneself and others. With a focus on actionable advice, the authors break EQ into four core skills: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. This book is a valuable resource for anyone looking to enhance their communication, decision-making, and leadership capabilities.</p>
