<br>
THE NAUGHTY BOY<br>
<br>
Along time ago, there lived an old poet, a thoroughly kind old poet. As<br>
he was sitting one evening in his room, a dreadful storm arose without,<br>
and the rain streamed down from heaven; but the old poet sat warm<br>
and comfortable in his chimney-corner, where the fire blazed and the<br>
roasting apple hissed.<br>
<br>
"Those who have not a roof over their heads will be wetted to the
skin,"<br>
said the good old poet.<br>
<br>
"Oh let me in! Let me in! I am cold, and I'm so wet!" exclaimed
suddenly<br>
a child that stood crying at the door and knocking for admittance, while<br>
the rain poured down, and the wind made all the windows rattle.<br>
<br>
"Poor thing!" said the old poet, as he went to open the door. There<br>
stood a little boy, quite naked, and the water ran down from his long<br>
golden hair; he trembled with cold, and had he not come into a warm room<br>
he would most certainly have perished in the frightful tempest.<br>
<br>
"Poor child!" said the old poet, as he took the boy by the hand.
"Come<br>
in, come in, and I will soon restore thee! Thou shalt have wine and<br>
roasted apples, for thou art verily a charming child!" And the boy was<br>
so really. His eyes were like two bright stars; and although the water<br>
trickled down his hair, it waved in beautiful curls. He looked exactly<br>
like a little angel, but he was so pale, and his whole body trembled<br>
with cold. He had a nice little bow in his hand, but it was quite<br>
spoiled by the rain, and the tints of his many-colored arrows ran one<br>
into the other.<br>
<br>
The old poet seated himself beside his hearth, and took the little<br>
fellow on his lap; he squeezed the water out of his dripping hair,<br>
warmed his hands between his own, and boiled for him some sweet wine.<br>
Then the boy recovered, his cheeks again grew rosy, he jumped down from<br>
the lap where he was sitting, and danced round the kind old poet.<br>
<br>
"You are a merry fellow," said the old man. "What's your
name?"<br>
<br>
"My name is Cupid," answered the boy. "Don't you know me? There
lies my<br>
bow; it shoots well, I can assure you! Look, the weather is now clearing<br>
up, and the moon is shining clear again through the window."<br>
<br>
"Why, your bow is quite spoiled," said the old poet.<br>
<br>
"That were sad indeed," said the boy, and he took the bow in his hand<br>
and examined it on every side. "Oh, it is dry again, and is not hurt at<br>
all; the string is quite tight. I will try it directly." And he bent his<br>
bow, took aim, and shot an arrow at the old poet, right into his heart.<br>
"You see now that my bow was not spoiled," said he laughing; and away
he<br>
ran.<br>
<br>
The naughty boy, to shoot the old poet in that way; he who had taken him<br>
into his warm room, who had treated him so kindly, and who had given him<br>
warm wine and the very best apples!<br>
<br>
The poor poet lay on the earth and wept, for the arrow had really flown<br>
into his heart.<br>
<br>
"Fie!" said he. "How naughty a boy Cupid is! I will tell all
children<br>
about him, that they may take care and not play with him, for he will<br>
only cause them sorrow and many a heartache."<br>
<br>
And all good children to whom he related this story, took great heed<br>
of this naughty Cupid; but he made fools of them still, for he is<br>
astonishingly cunning. When the university students come from the<br>
lectures, he runs beside them in a black coat, and with a book under his<br>
arm. It is quite impossible for them to know him, and they walk along<br>
with him arm in arm, as if he, too, were a student like themselves; and<br>
then, unperceived, he thrusts an arrow to their bosom. When the young<br>
maidens come from being examined by the clergyman, or go to church to<br>
be confirmed, there he is again close behind them. Yes, he is forever<br>
following people. At the play, he sits in the great chandelier and burns<br>
in bright flames, so that people think it is really a flame, but they<br>
soon discover it is something else. He roves about in the garden of the<br>
palace and upon the ramparts: yes, once he even shot your father and<br>
mother right in the heart. Ask them only and you will hear what they'll<br>
tell you. Oh, he is a naughty boy, that Cupid; you must never have<br>
anything to do with him. He is forever running after everybody. Only<br>
think, he shot an arrow once at your old grandmother! But that is a<br>
long time ago, and it is all past now; however, a thing of that sort she<br>
never forgets. Fie, naughty Cupid! But now you know him, and you know,<br>
too, how ill-behaved he is!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
THE RED SHOES<br>
<br>
There was once a little girl who was very pretty and delicate, but in<br>
summer she was forced to run about with bare feet, she was so poor, and<br>
in winter wear very large wooden shoes, which made her little insteps<br>
quite red, and that looked so dangerous!<br>
<br>
In the middle of the village lived old Dame Shoemaker; she sat and sewed<br>
together, as well as she could, a little pair of shoes out of old red<br>
strips of cloth; they were very clumsy, but it was a kind thought. They<br>
were meant for the little girl. The little girl was called Karen.<br>
<br>
On the very day her mother was buried, Karen received the red shoes,<br>
and wore them for the first time. They were certainly not intended for<br>
mourning, but she had no others, and with stockingless feet she followed<br>
the poor straw coffin in them.<br>
<br>
Suddenly a large old carriage drove up, and a large old lady sat in it:<br>
she looked at the little girl, felt compassion for her, and then said to<br>
the clergyman:<br>
<br>
"Here, give me the little girl. I will adopt her!"<br>
<br>
And Karen believed all this happened on account of the red shoes, but<br>
the old lady thought they were horrible, and they were burnt. But Karen<br>
herself was cleanly and nicely dressed; she must learn to read and sew;<br>
and people said she was a nice little thing, but the looking-glass said:<br>
"Thou art more than nice, thou art beautiful!"<br>
<br>
Now the queen once travelled through the land, and she had her little<br>
daughter with her. And this little daughter was a princess, and people<br>
streamed to the castle, and Karen was there also, and the little<br>
princess stood in her fine white dress, in a window, and let herself be<br>
stared at; she had neither a train nor a golden crown, but splendid<br>
red morocco shoes. They were certainly far handsomer than those Dame<br>
Shoemaker had made for little Karen. Nothing in the world can be<br>
compared with red shoes.<br>
<br>
Now Karen was old enough to be confirmed; she had new clothes and was to<br>
have new shoes also. The rich shoemaker in the city took the measure of<br>
her little foot. This took place at his house, in his room; where stood<br>
large glass-cases, filled with elegant shoes and brilliant boots. All<br>
this looked charming, but the old lady could not see well, and so had<br>
no pleasure in them. In the midst of the shoes stood a pair of red ones,<br>
just like those the princess had worn. How beautiful they were! The<br>
shoemaker said also they had been made for the child of a count, but had<br>
not fitted.<br>
<br>
"That must be patent leather!" said the old lady. "They shine
so!"<br>
<br>
"Yes, they shine!" said Karen, and they fitted, and were bought, but
the<br>
old lady knew nothing about their being red, else she would never have<br>
allowed Karen to have gone in red shoes to be confirmed. Yet such was<br>
the case.<br>
<br>
Everybody looked at her feet; and when she stepped through the chancel<br>
door on the church pavement, it seemed to her as if the old figures on<br>
the tombs, those portraits of old preachers and preachers' wives, with<br>
stiff ruffs, and long black dresses, fixed their eyes on her red shoes.<br>
And she thought only of them as the clergyman laid his hand upon her<br>
head, and spoke of the holy baptism, of the covenant with God, and how<br>
she should be now a matured Christian; and the organ pealed so solemnly;<br>
the sweet children's voices sang, and the old music-directors sang, but<br>
Karen only thought of her red shoes.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, the old lady heard from everyone that the shoes had<br>
been red, and she said that it was very wrong of Karen, that it was not<br>
at all becoming, and that in future Karen should only go in black shoes<br>
to church, even when she should be older.<br>
<br>
The next Sunday there was the sacrament, and Karen looked at the black<br>
shoes, looked at the red ones--looked at them again, and put on the red<br>
shoes.<br>
<br>
The sun shone gloriously; Karen and the old lady walked along the path<br>
through the corn; it was rather dusty there.<br>
<br>
At the church door stood an old soldier with a crutch, and with a<br>
wonderfully long beard, which was more red than white, and he bowed to<br>
the ground, and asked the old lady whether he might dust her shoes. And<br>
Karen stretched out her little foot.<br>
<br>
"See, what beautiful dancing shoes!" said the soldier. "Sit firm
when<br>
you dance"; and he put his hand out towards the soles.<br>
<br>
And the old lady gave the old soldier alms, and went into the church<br>
with Karen.<br>
<br>
And all the people in the church looked at Karen's red shoes, and all<br>
the pictures, and as Karen knelt before the altar, and raised the cup to<br>
her lips, she only thought of the red shoes, and they seemed to swim<br>
in it; and she forgot to sing her psalm, and she forgot to pray, "Our<br>
Father in Heaven!"<br>
<br>
Now all the people went out of church, and the old lady got into her<br>
carriage. Karen raised her foot to get in after her, when the old<br>
soldier said,<br>
<br>
"Look, what beautiful dancing shoes!"<br>
<br>
And Karen could not help dancing a step or two, and when she began her<br>
feet continued to dance; it was just as though the shoes had power over<br>
them. She danced round the church corner, she could not leave off; the<br>
coachman was obliged to run after and catch hold of her, and he lifted<br>
her in the carriage, but her feet continued to dance so that she trod on<br>
the old lady dreadfully. At length she took the shoes off, and then her<br>
legs had peace.<br>
<br>
The shoes were placed in a closet at home, but Karen could not avoid<br>
looking at them.<br>
<br>
Now the old lady was sick, and it was said she could not recover. She<br>
must be nursed and waited upon, and there was no one whose duty it was<br>
so much as Karen's. But there was a great ball in the city, to which<br>
Karen was invited. She looked at the old lady, who could not recover,<br>
she looked at the red shoes, and she thought there could be no sin in<br>
it; she put on the red shoes, she might do that also, she thought. But<br>
then she went to the ball and began to dance.<br>
<br>
When she wanted to dance to the right, the shoes would dance to the<br>
left, and when she wanted to dance up the room, the shoes danced back<br>
again, down the steps, into the street, and out of the city gate. She<br>
danced, and was forced to dance straight out into the gloomy wood.<br>
<br>
Then it was suddenly light up among the trees, and she fancied it must<br>
be the moon, for there was a face; but it was the old soldier with<br>
the red beard; he sat there, nodded his head, and said, "Look, what<br>
beautiful dancing shoes!"<br>
<br>
Then she was terrified, and wanted to fling off the red shoes, but they<br>
clung fast; and she pulled down her stockings, but the shoes seemed to<br>
have grown to her feet. And she danced, and must dance, over fields and<br>
meadows, in rain and sunshine, by night and day; but at night it was the<br>
most fearful.<br>
<br>
She danced over the churchyard, but the dead did not dance--they had<br>
something better to do than to dance. She wished to seat herself on a<br>
poor man's grave, where the bitter tansy grew; but for her there was<br>
neither peace nor rest; and when she danced towards the open church<br>
door, she saw an angel standing there. He wore long, white garments; he<br>
had wings which reached from his shoulders to the earth; his countenance<br>
was severe and grave; and in his hand he held a sword, broad and<br>
glittering.<br>
<br>
"Dance shalt thou!" said he. "Dance in thy red shoes till thou
art pale<br>
and cold! Till thy skin shrivels up and thou art a skeleton! Dance shalt<br>
thou from door to door, and where proud, vain children dwell, thou shalt<br>
knock, that they may hear thee and tremble! Dance shalt thou--!"<br>
<br>
"Mercy!" cried Karen. But she did not hear the angel's reply, for the<br>
shoes carried her through the gate into the fields, across roads and<br>
bridges, and she must keep ever dancing.<br>
<br>
One morning she danced past a door which she well knew. Within sounded<br>
a psalm; a coffin, decked with flowers, was borne forth. Then she knew<br>
that the old lady was dead, and felt that she was abandoned by all, and<br>
condemned by the angel of God.<br>
<br>
She danced, and she was forced to dance through the gloomy night. The<br>
shoes carried her over stack and stone; she was torn till she bled; she<br>
danced over the heath till she came to a little house. Here, she knew,<br>
dwelt the executioner; and she tapped with her fingers at the window,<br>
and said, "Come out! Come out! I cannot come in, for I am forced to<br>
dance!"<br>
<br>
And the executioner said, "Thou dost not know who I am, I fancy? I<br>
strike bad people's heads off; and I hear that my axe rings!"<br>
<br>
"Don't strike my head off!" said Karen. "Then I can't repent of
my sins!<br>
But strike off my feet in the red shoes!"<br>
<br>
And then she confessed her entire sin, and the executioner struck off<br>
her feet with the red shoes, but the shoes danced away with the little<br>
feet across the field into the deep wood.<br>
<br>
And he carved out little wooden feet for her, and crutches, taught<br>
her the psalm criminals always sing; and she kissed the hand which had<br>
wielded the axe, and went over the heath.<br>
<br>
"Now I have suffered enough for the red shoes!" said she. "Now I
will<br>
go into the church that people may see me!" And she hastened towards the<br>
church door: but when she was near it, the red shoes danced before her,<br>
and she was terrified, and turned round. The whole week she was unhappy,<br>
and wept many bitter tears; but when Sunday returned, she said, "Well,<br>
now I have suffered and struggled enough! I really believe I am as good<br>
as many a one who sits in the church, and holds her head so high!"<br>
<br>
And away she went boldly; but she had not got farther than the<br>
churchyard gate before she saw the red shoes dancing before her; and she<br>
was frightened, and turned back, and repented of her sin from her heart.<br>
<br>
And she went to the parsonage, and begged that they would take her<br>
into service; she would be very industrious, she said, and would do<br>
everything she could; she did not care about the wages, only she wished<br>
to have a home, and be with good people. And the clergyman's wife was<br>
sorry for her and took her into service; and she was industrious and<br>
thoughtful. She sat still and listened when the clergyman read the Bible<br>
in the evenings. All the children thought a great deal of her; but when<br>
they spoke of dress, and grandeur, and beauty, she shook her head.<br>
<br>
The following Sunday, when the family was going to church, they asked<br>
her whether she would not go with them; but she glanced sorrowfully,<br>
with tears in her eyes, at her crutches. The family went to hear the<br>
word of God; but she went alone into her little chamber; there was only<br>
room for a bed and chair to stand in it; and here she sat down with her<br>
Prayer-Book; and whilst she read with a pious mind, the wind bore<br>
the strains of the organ towards her, and she raised her tearful<br>
countenance, and said, "O God, help me!"<br>
<br>
And the sun shone so clearly, and straight before her stood the angel<br>
of God in white garments, the same she had seen that night at the church<br>
door; but he no longer carried the sharp sword, but in its stead a<br>
splendid green spray, full of roses. And he touched the ceiling with the<br>
spray, and the ceiling rose so high, and where he had touched it there<br>
gleamed a golden star. And he touched the walls, and they widened out,<br>
and she saw the organ which was playing; she saw the old pictures of the<br>
preachers and the preachers' wives. The congregation sat in cushioned<br>
seats, and sang out of their Prayer-Books. For the church itself had<br>
come to the poor girl in her narrow chamber, or else she had come into<br>
the church. She sat in the pew with the clergyman's family, and when<br>
they had ended the psalm and looked up, they nodded and said, "It is<br>
right that thou art come!"<br>
<br>
"It was through mercy!" she said.<br>
<br>
And the organ pealed, and the children's voices in the choir sounded so<br>
sweet and soft! The clear sunshine streamed so warmly through the window<br>
into the pew where Karen sat! Her heart was so full of sunshine, peace,<br>
and joy, that it broke. Her soul flew on the sunshine to God, and there<br>
no one asked after the RED SHOES.<br>
