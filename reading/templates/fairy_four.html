    <p class="w3-large"><strong>The Fir Tree</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
Out in the woods stood a nice little Fir Tree. The place he had was a<br>
very good one: the sun shone on him: as to fresh air, there was enough<br>
of that, and round him grew many large-sized comrades, pines as well as<br>
firs. But the little Fir wanted so very much to be a grown-up tree.<br>
<br>
He did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air; he did not care<br>
for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they<br>
were in the woods looking for wild-strawberries. The children often came<br>
with a whole pitcher full of berries, or a long row of them threaded on<br>
a straw, and sat down near the young tree and said, "Oh, how pretty he<br>
is! What a nice little fir!" But this was what the Tree could not bear<br>
to hear.<br>
<br>
At the end of a year he had shot up a good deal, and after another year<br>
he was another long bit taller; for with fir trees one can always tell<br>
by the shoots how many years old they are.<br>
<br>
"Oh! Were I but such a high tree as the others are," sighed he.
"Then I<br>
should be able to spread out my branches, and with the tops to look into<br>
the wide world! Then would the birds build nests among my branches: and<br>
when there was a breeze, I could bend with as much stateliness as the<br>
others!"<br>
<br>
Neither the sunbeams, nor the birds, nor the red clouds which morning<br>
and evening sailed above him, gave the little Tree any pleasure.<br>
<br>
In winter, when the snow lay glittering on the ground, a hare would<br>
often come leaping along, and jump right over the little Tree. Oh, that<br>
made him so angry! But two winters were past, and in the third the Tree<br>
was so large that the hare was obliged to go round it. "To grow and<br>
grow, to get older and be tall," thought the Tree--"that, after all,
is<br>
the most delightful thing in the world!"<br>
<br>
In autumn the wood-cutters always came and felled some of the largest<br>
trees. This happened every year; and the young Fir Tree, that had now<br>
grown to a very comely size, trembled at the sight; for the magnificent<br>
great trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking, the branches were<br>
lopped off, and the trees looked long and bare; they were hardly to be<br>
recognised; and then they were laid in carts, and the horses dragged<br>
them out of the wood.<br>
<br>
Where did they go to? What became of them?<br>
<br>
In spring, when the swallows and the storks came, the Tree asked them,<br>
"Don't you know where they have been taken? Have you not met them<br>
anywhere?"<br>
<br>
The swallows did not know anything about it; but the Stork looked<br>
musing, nodded his head, and said, "Yes; I think I know; I met many<br>
ships as I was flying hither from Egypt; on the ships were magnificent<br>
masts, and I venture to assert that it was they that smelt so of fir.<br>
I may congratulate you, for they lifted themselves on high most<br>
majestically!"<br>
<br>
"Oh, were I but old enough to fly across the sea! But how does the sea<br>
look in reality? What is it like?"<br>
<br>
"That would take a long time to explain," said the Stork, and with
these<br>
words off he went.<br>
<br>
"Rejoice in thy growth!" said the Sunbeams. "Rejoice in thy
vigorous<br>
growth, and in the fresh life that moveth within thee!"<br>
<br>
And the Wind kissed the Tree, and the Dew wept tears over him; but the<br>
Fir understood it not.<br>
<br>
When Christmas came, quite young trees were cut down: trees which often<br>
were not even as large or of the same age as this Fir Tree, who could<br>
never rest, but always wanted to be off. These young trees, and they<br>
were always the finest looking, retained their branches; they were laid<br>
on carts, and the horses drew them out of the wood.<br>
<br>
"Where are they going to?" asked the Fir. "They are not taller
than<br>
I; there was one indeed that was considerably shorter; and why do they<br>
retain all their branches? Whither are they taken?"<br>
<br>
"We know! We know!" chirped the Sparrows. "We have peeped in at
the<br>
windows in the town below! We know whither they are taken! The greatest<br>
splendor and the greatest magnificence one can imagine await them. We<br>
peeped through the windows, and saw them planted in the middle of the<br>
warm room and ornamented with the most splendid things, with gilded<br>
apples, with gingerbread, with toys, and many hundred lights!"<br>
<br>
"And then?" asked the Fir Tree, trembling in every bough. "And
then?<br>
What happens then?"<br>
<br>
"We did not see anything more: it was incomparably beautiful."<br>
<br>
"I would fain know if I am destined for so glorious a career," cried<br>
the Tree, rejoicing. "That is still better than to cross the sea! What<br>
a longing do I suffer! Were Christmas but come! I am now tall, and my<br>
branches spread like the others that were carried off last year! Oh!<br>
were I but already on the cart! Were I in the warm room with all the<br>
splendor and magnificence! Yes; then something better, something still<br>
grander, will surely follow, or wherefore should they thus ornament me?<br>
Something better, something still grander must follow--but what? Oh, how<br>
I long, how I suffer! I do not know myself what is the matter with me!"<br>
<br>
"Rejoice in our presence!" said the Air and the Sunlight.
"Rejoice in<br>
thy own fresh youth!"<br>
<br>
But the Tree did not rejoice at all; he grew and grew, and was green<br>
both winter and summer. People that saw him said, "What a fine tree!"<br>
and towards Christmas he was one of the first that was cut down. The axe<br>
struck deep into the very pith; the Tree fell to the earth with a sigh;<br>
he felt a pang--it was like a swoon; he could not think of happiness,<br>
for he was sorrowful at being separated from his home, from the place<br>
where he had sprung up. He well knew that he should never see his dear<br>
old comrades, the little bushes and flowers around him, anymore; perhaps<br>
not even the birds! The departure was not at all agreeable.<br>
<br>
The Tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a court-yard with<br>
the other trees, and heard a man say, "That one is splendid! We don't<br>
want the others." Then two servants came in rich livery and carried the<br>
Fir Tree into a large and splendid drawing-room. Portraits were hanging<br>
on the walls, and near the white porcelain stove stood two large Chinese<br>
vases with lions on the covers. There, too, were large easy-chairs,<br>
silken sofas, large tables full of picture-books and full of toys, worth<br>
hundreds and hundreds of crowns--at least the children said so. And the<br>
Fir Tree was stuck upright in a cask that was filled with sand; but no<br>
one could see that it was a cask, for green cloth was hung all round it,<br>
and it stood on a large gaily-colored carpet. Oh! how the Tree quivered!<br>
What was to happen? The servants, as well as the young ladies, decorated<br>
it. On one branch there hung little nets cut out of colored paper, and<br>
each net was filled with sugarplums; and among the other boughs gilded<br>
apples and walnuts were suspended, looking as though they had grown<br>
there, and little blue and white tapers were placed among the leaves.<br>
Dolls that looked for all the world like men--the Tree had never beheld<br>
such before--were seen among the foliage, and at the very top a<br>
large star of gold tinsel was fixed. It was really splendid--beyond<br>
description splendid.<br>
<br>
"This evening!" they all said. "How it will shine this
evening!"<br>
<br>
"Oh!" thought the Tree. "If the evening were but come! If the
tapers<br>
were but lighted! And then I wonder what will happen! Perhaps the other<br>
trees from the forest will come to look at me! Perhaps the sparrows will<br>
beat against the windowpanes! I wonder if I shall take root here, and<br>
winter and summer stand covered with ornaments!"<br>
<br>
He knew very much about the matter--but he was so impatient that for<br>
sheer longing he got a pain in his back, and this with trees is the same<br>
thing as a headache with us.<br>
<br>
The candles were now lighted--what brightness! What splendor! The<br>
Tree trembled so in every bough that one of the tapers set fire to the<br>
foliage. It blazed up famously.<br>
<br>
"Help! Help!" cried the young ladies, and they quickly put out the
fire.<br>
<br>
Now the Tree did not even dare tremble. What a state he was in! He was<br>
so uneasy lest he should lose something of his splendor, that he was<br>
quite bewildered amidst the glare and brightness; when suddenly both<br>
folding-doors opened and a troop of children rushed in as if they would<br>
upset the Tree. The older persons followed quietly; the little ones<br>
stood quite still. But it was only for a moment; then they shouted that<br>
the whole place re-echoed with their rejoicing; they danced round the<br>
Tree, and one present after the other was pulled off.<br>
<br>
"What are they about?" thought the Tree. "What is to happen
now!" And<br>
the lights burned down to the very branches, and as they burned down<br>
they were put out one after the other, and then the children had<br>
permission to plunder the Tree. So they fell upon it with such violence<br>
that all its branches cracked; if it had not been fixed firmly in the<br>
ground, it would certainly have tumbled down.<br>
<br>
The children danced about with their beautiful playthings; no one looked<br>
at the Tree except the old nurse, who peeped between the branches; but<br>
it was only to see if there was a fig or an apple left that had been<br>
forgotten.<br>
<br>
"A story! A story!" cried the children, drawing a little fat man
towards<br>
the Tree. He seated himself under it and said, "Now we are in the shade,<br>
and the Tree can listen too. But I shall tell only one story. Now which<br>
will you have; that about Ivedy-Avedy, or about Humpy-Dumpy, who<br>
tumbled downstairs, and yet after all came to the throne and married the<br>
princess?"<br>
<br>
"Ivedy-Avedy," cried some; "Humpy-Dumpy," cried the others.
There was<br>
such a bawling and screaming--the Fir Tree alone was silent, and he<br>
thought to himself, "Am I not to bawl with the rest? Am I to do nothing<br>
whatever?" for he was one of the company, and had done what he had to<br>
do.<br>
<br>
And the man told about Humpy-Dumpy that tumbled down, who<br>
notwithstanding came to the throne, and at last married the princess.<br>
And the children clapped their hands, and cried. "Oh, go on! Do go
on!"<br>
They wanted to hear about Ivedy-Avedy too, but the little man only told<br>
them about Humpy-Dumpy. The Fir Tree stood quite still and absorbed<br>
in thought; the birds in the wood had never related the like of this.<br>
"Humpy-Dumpy fell downstairs, and yet he married the princess! Yes, yes!<br>
That's the way of the world!" thought the Fir Tree, and believed it all,<br>
because the man who told the story was so good-looking. "Well, well! who<br>
knows, perhaps I may fall downstairs, too, and get a princess as wife!"<br>
And he looked forward with joy to the morrow, when he hoped to be decked<br>
out again with lights, playthings, fruits, and tinsel.<br>
<br>
"I won't tremble to-morrow!" thought the Fir Tree. "I will enjoy
to<br>
the full all my splendor! To-morrow I shall hear again the story of<br>
Humpy-Dumpy, and perhaps that of Ivedy-Avedy too." And the whole night<br>
the Tree stood still and in deep thought.<br>
<br>
In the morning the servant and the housemaid came in.<br>
<br>
"Now then the splendor will begin again," thought the Fir. But they<br>
dragged him out of the room, and up the stairs into the loft: and here,<br>
in a dark corner, where no daylight could enter, they left him. "What's<br>
the meaning of this?" thought the Tree. "What am I to do here? What<br>
shall I hear now, I wonder?" And he leaned against the wall lost in<br>
reverie. Time enough had he too for his reflections; for days and nights<br>
passed on, and nobody came up; and when at last somebody did come, it<br>
was only to put some great trunks in a corner, out of the way. There<br>
stood the Tree quite hidden; it seemed as if he had been entirely<br>
forgotten.<br>
<br>
"'Tis now winter out-of-doors!" thought the Tree. "The earth is
hard and<br>
covered with snow; men cannot plant me now, and therefore I have been<br>
put up here under shelter till the spring-time comes! How thoughtful<br>
that is! How kind man is, after all! If it only were not so dark here,<br>
and so terribly lonely! Not even a hare! And out in the woods it was<br>
so pleasant, when the snow was on the ground, and the hare leaped by;<br>
yes--even when he jumped over me; but I did not like it then! It is<br>
really terribly lonely here!"<br>
<br>
"Squeak! Squeak!" said a little Mouse, at the same moment, peeping
out<br>
of his hole. And then another little one came. They snuffed about the<br>
Fir Tree, and rustled among the branches.<br>
<br>
"It is dreadfully cold," said the Mouse. "But for that, it would
be<br>
delightful here, old Fir, wouldn't it?"<br>
<br>
"I am by no means old," said the Fir Tree. "There's many a one<br>
considerably older than I am."<br>
<br>
"Where do you come from," asked the Mice; "and what can you
do?" They<br>
were so extremely curious. "Tell us about the most beautiful spot on the<br>
earth. Have you never been there? Were you never in the larder, where<br>
cheeses lie on the shelves, and hams hang from above; where one dances<br>
about on tallow candles: that place where one enters lean, and comes out<br>
again fat and portly?"<br>
<br>
"I know no such place," said the Tree. "But I know the wood,
where the<br>
sun shines and where the little birds sing." And then he told all about<br>
his youth; and the little Mice had never heard the like before; and they<br>
listened and said,<br>
<br>
"Well, to be sure! How much you have seen! How happy you must have<br>
been!"<br>
<br>
"I!" said the Fir Tree, thinking over what he had himself related.<br>
"Yes, in reality those were happy times." And then he told about<br>
Christmas-eve, when he was decked out with cakes and candles.<br>
<br>
"Oh," said the little Mice, "how fortunate you have been, old
Fir Tree!"<br>
<br>
"I am by no means old," said he. "I came from the wood this
winter; I am<br>
in my prime, and am only rather short for my age."<br>
<br>
"What delightful stories you know," said the Mice: and the next night<br>
they came with four other little Mice, who were to hear what the Tree<br>
recounted: and the more he related, the more he remembered himself; and<br>
it appeared as if those times had really been happy times. "But they may<br>
still come--they may still come! Humpy-Dumpy fell downstairs, and yet<br>
he got a princess!" and he thought at the moment of a nice little Birch<br>
Tree growing out in the woods: to the Fir, that would be a real charming<br>
princess.<br>
<br>
"Who is Humpy-Dumpy?" asked the Mice. So then the Fir Tree told the<br>
whole fairy tale, for he could remember every single word of it; and the<br>
little Mice jumped for joy up to the very top of the Tree. Next night<br>
two more Mice came, and on Sunday two Rats even; but they said the<br>
stories were not interesting, which vexed the little Mice; and they,<br>
too, now began to think them not so very amusing either.<br>
<br>
"Do you know only one story?" asked the Rats.<br>
<br>
"Only that one," answered the Tree. "I heard it on my happiest
evening;<br>
but I did not then know how happy I was."<br>
<br>
"It is a very stupid story! Don't you know one about bacon and tallow<br>
candles? Can't you tell any larder stories?"<br>
<br>
"No," said the Tree.<br>
<br>
"Then good-bye," said the Rats; and they went home.<br>
<br>
At last the little Mice stayed away also; and the Tree sighed: "After<br>
all, it was very pleasant when the sleek little Mice sat round me, and<br>
listened to what I told them. Now that too is over. But I will take good<br>
care to enjoy myself when I am brought out again."<br>
<br>
But when was that to be? Why, one morning there came a quantity of<br>
people and set to work in the loft. The trunks were moved, the tree was<br>
pulled out and thrown--rather hard, it is true--down on the floor, but a<br>
man drew him towards the stairs, where the daylight shone.<br>
<br>
"Now a merry life will begin again," thought the Tree. He felt the
fresh<br>
air, the first sunbeam--and now he was out in the courtyard. All passed<br>
so quickly, there was so much going on around him, the Tree quite forgot<br>
to look to himself. The court adjoined a garden, and all was in flower;<br>
the roses hung so fresh and odorous over the balustrade, the lindens<br>
were in blossom, the Swallows flew by, and said, "Quirre-vit! My husband<br>
is come!" but it was not the Fir Tree that they meant.<br>
<br>
"Now, then, I shall really enjoy life," said he exultingly, and
spread<br>
out his branches; but, alas, they were all withered and yellow! It was<br>
in a corner that he lay, among weeds and nettles. The golden star of<br>
tinsel was still on the top of the Tree, and glittered in the sunshine.<br>
<br>
In the court-yard some of the merry children were playing who had danced<br>
at Christmas round the Fir Tree, and were so glad at the sight of him.<br>
One of the youngest ran and tore off the golden star.<br>
<br>
"Only look what is still on the ugly old Christmas tree!" said he,<br>
trampling on the branches, so that they all cracked beneath his feet.<br>
<br>
And the Tree beheld all the beauty of the flowers, and the freshness in<br>
the garden; he beheld himself, and wished he had remained in his dark<br>
corner in the loft; he thought of his first youth in the wood, of the<br>
merry Christmas-eve, and of the little Mice who had listened with so<br>
much pleasure to the story of Humpy-Dumpy.<br>
<br>
"'Tis over--'tis past!" said the poor Tree. "Had I but rejoiced
when I<br>
had reason to do so! But now 'tis past, 'tis past!"<br>
<br>
And the gardener's boy chopped the Tree into small pieces; there was a<br>
whole heap lying there. The wood flamed up splendidly under the large<br>
brewing copper, and it sighed so deeply! Each sigh was like a shot.<br>
<br>
The boys played about in the court, and the youngest wore the gold star<br>
on his breast which the Tree had had on the happiest evening of his<br>
life. However, that was over now--the Tree gone, the story at an end.<br>
All, all was over--every tale must end at last.<br>

        <p>2. During Christmas, the Fir Tree was cut down and decorated with candles, playthings, and fruits. Children danced around him, and he hoped for something grand to happen. However, after Christmas, he was discarded and stored in a dark corner, and the decorations were taken away. The Fir Tree felt forgotten and longed for the joy of Christmas to return.</p>
        <p>3. In the end, the Fir Tree was chopped into small pieces by the gardener's boy. As he was being burned, he reflected on his past experiences, realizing that he should have appreciated and enjoyed the moments of happiness he had, instead of longing for something more. He regretted not rejoicing when he had the chance.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>THE SNOW QUEEN - FIRST STORY. Which Treats of a Mirror and of the Splinters</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
Now then, let us begin. When we are at the end of the story, we shall<br>
know more than we know now: but to begin.<br>
<br>
Once upon a time there was a wicked sprite, indeed he was the most<br>
mischievous of all sprites. One day he was in a very good humor, for<br>
he had made a mirror with the power of causing all that was good and<br>
beautiful when it was reflected therein, to look poor and mean; but<br>
that which was good-for-nothing and looked ugly was shown magnified<br>
and increased in ugliness. In this mirror the most beautiful landscapes<br>
looked like boiled spinach, and the best persons were turned into<br>
frights, or appeared to stand on their heads; their faces were so<br>
distorted that they were not to be recognised; and if anyone had a mole,<br>
you might be sure that it would be magnified and spread over both nose<br>
and mouth.<br>
<br>
"That's glorious fun!" said the sprite. If a good thought passed
through<br>
a man's mind, then a grin was seen in the mirror, and the sprite laughed<br>
heartily at his clever discovery. All the little sprites who went to his<br>
school--for he kept a sprite school--told each other that a miracle had<br>
happened; and that now only, as they thought, it would be possible to<br>
see how the world really looked. They ran about with the mirror; and at<br>
last there was not a land or a person who was not represented distorted<br>
in the mirror. So then they thought they would fly up to the sky,<br>
and have a joke there. The higher they flew with the mirror, the more<br>
terribly it grinned: they could hardly hold it fast. Higher and higher<br>
still they flew, nearer and nearer to the stars, when suddenly the<br>
mirror shook so terribly with grinning, that it flew out of their hands<br>
and fell to the earth, where it was dashed in a hundred million and more<br>
pieces. And now it worked much more evil than before; for some of these<br>
pieces were hardly so large as a grain of sand, and they flew about in<br>
the wide world, and when they got into people's eyes, there they stayed;<br>
and then people saw everything perverted, or only had an eye for that<br>
which was evil. This happened because the very smallest bit had the<br>
same power which the whole mirror had possessed. Some persons even got<br>
a splinter in their heart, and then it made one shudder, for their heart<br>
became like a lump of ice. Some of the broken pieces were so large that<br>
they were used for windowpanes, through which one could not see one's<br>
friends. Other pieces were put in spectacles; and that was a sad affair<br>
when people put on their glasses to see well and rightly. Then the<br>
wicked sprite laughed till he almost choked, for all this tickled his<br>
fancy. The fine splinters still flew about in the air: and now we shall<br>
hear what happened next.<br>

        <p>1. The wicked sprite's mirror had the power to make everything good and beautiful appear poor and mean when reflected in it, while magnifying and distorting anything ugly or worthless. This caused mischief because people and landscapes, when seen through the mirror, appeared distorted and unpleasant. The mirror shattered into tiny pieces, and these splinters continued to cause trouble by distorting people's perceptions and making them see only the negative or evil aspects of things.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>SECOND STORY. A Little Boy and a Little Girl</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
In a large town, where there are so many houses, and so many people,<br>
that there is no roof left for everybody to have a little garden; and<br>
where, on this account, most persons are obliged to content themselves<br>
with flowers in pots; there lived two little children, who had a garden<br>
somewhat larger than a flower-pot. They were not brother and sister; but<br>
they cared for each other as much as if they were. Their parents lived<br>
exactly opposite. They inhabited two garrets; and where the roof of the<br>
one house joined that of the other, and the gutter ran along the extreme<br>
end of it, there was to each house a small window: one needed only to<br>
step over the gutter to get from one window to the other.<br>
<br>
The children's parents had large wooden boxes there, in which vegetables<br>
for the kitchen were planted, and little rosetrees besides: there was a<br>
rose in each box, and they grew splendidly. They now thought of placing<br>
the boxes across the gutter, so that they nearly reached from one window<br>
to the other, and looked just like two walls of flowers. The tendrils<br>
of the peas hung down over the boxes; and the rose-trees shot up long<br>
branches, twined round the windows, and then bent towards each other: it<br>
was almost like a triumphant arch of foliage and flowers. The boxes were<br>
very high, and the children knew that they must not creep over them; so<br>
they often obtained permission to get out of the windows to each other,<br>
and to sit on their little stools among the roses, where they could play<br>
delightfully. In winter there was an end of this pleasure. The windows<br>
were often frozen over; but then they heated copper farthings on the<br>
stove, and laid the hot farthing on the windowpane, and then they had a<br>
capital peep-hole, quite nicely rounded; and out of each peeped a gentle<br>
friendly eye--it was the little boy and the little girl who were looking<br>
out. His name was Kay, hers was Gerda. In summer, with one jump, they<br>
could get to each other; but in winter they were obliged first to<br>
go down the long stairs, and then up the long stairs again: and<br>
out-of-doors there was quite a snow-storm.<br>
<br>
"It is the white bees that are swarming," said Kay's old grandmother.<br>
<br>
"Do the white bees choose a queen?" asked the little boy; for he knew<br>
that the honey-bees always have one.<br>
<br>
"Yes," said the grandmother, "she flies where the swarm hangs in
the<br>
thickest clusters. She is the largest of all; and she can never remain<br>
quietly on the earth, but goes up again into the black clouds. Many a<br>
winter's night she flies through the streets of the town, and peeps in<br>
at the windows; and they then freeze in so wondrous a manner that they<br>
look like flowers."<br>
<br>
"Yes, I have seen it," said both the children; and so they knew that
it<br>
was true.<br>
<br>
"Can the Snow Queen come in?" said the little girl.<br>
<br>
"Only let her come in!" said the little boy. "Then I'd put her
on the<br>
stove, and she'd melt."<br>
<br>
And then his grandmother patted his head and told him other stories.<br>
<br>
In the evening, when little Kay was at home, and half undressed, he<br>
climbed up on the chair by the window, and peeped out of the little<br>
hole. A few snow-flakes were falling, and one, the largest of all,<br>
remained lying on the edge of a flower-pot.<br>
<br>
The flake of snow grew larger and larger; and at last it was like a<br>
young lady, dressed in the finest white gauze, made of a million little<br>
flakes like stars. She was so beautiful and delicate, but she was of<br>
ice, of dazzling, sparkling ice; yet she lived; her eyes gazed fixedly,<br>
like two stars; but there was neither quiet nor repose in them. She<br>
nodded towards the window, and beckoned with her hand. The little boy<br>
was frightened, and jumped down from the chair; it seemed to him as if,<br>
at the same moment, a large bird flew past the window.<br>
<br>
The next day it was a sharp frost--and then the spring came; the sun<br>
shone, the green leaves appeared, the swallows built their nests, the<br>
windows were opened, and the little children again sat in their pretty<br>
garden, high up on the leads at the top of the house.<br>
<br>
That summer the roses flowered in unwonted beauty. The little girl had<br>
learned a hymn, in which there was something about roses; and then she<br>
thought of her own flowers; and she sang the verse to the little boy,<br>
who then sang it with her:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The rose in the valley is blooming so sweet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And angels descend there the children to greet."<br>
<br>
And the children held each other by the hand, kissed the roses, looked<br>
up at the clear sunshine, and spoke as though they really saw angels<br>
there. What lovely summer-days those were! How delightful to be out in<br>
the air, near the fresh rose-bushes, that seem as if they would never<br>
finish blossoming!<br>
<br>
Kay and Gerda looked at the picture-book full of beasts and of birds;<br>
and it was then--the clock in the church-tower was just striking<br>
five--that Kay said, "Oh! I feel such a sharp pain in my heart; and now<br>
something has got into my eye!"<br>
<br>
The little girl put her arms around his neck. He winked his eyes; now<br>
there was nothing to be seen.<br>
<br>
"I think it is out now," said he; but it was not. It was just one of<br>
those pieces of glass from the magic mirror that had got into his eye;<br>
and poor Kay had got another piece right in his heart. It will soon<br>
become like ice. It did not hurt any longer, but there it was.<br>
<br>
"What are you crying for?" asked he. "You look so ugly! There's
nothing<br>
the matter with me. Ah," said he at once, "that rose is cankered! And<br>
look, this one is quite crooked! After all, these roses are very ugly!<br>
They are just like the box they are planted in!" And then he gave the<br>
box a good kick with his foot, and pulled both the roses up.<br>
<br>
"What are you doing?" cried the little girl; and as he perceived her<br>
fright, he pulled up another rose, got in at the window, and hastened<br>
off from dear little Gerda.<br>
<br>
Afterwards, when she brought her picture-book, he asked, "What horrid<br>
beasts have you there?" And if his grandmother told them stories, he<br>
always interrupted her; besides, if he could manage it, he would get<br>
behind her, put on her spectacles, and imitate her way of speaking; he<br>
copied all her ways, and then everybody laughed at him. He was soon able<br>
to imitate the gait and manner of everyone in the street. Everything<br>
that was peculiar and displeasing in them--that Kay knew how to imitate:<br>
and at such times all the people said, "The boy is certainly very<br>
clever!" But it was the glass he had got in his eye; the glass that was<br>
sticking in his heart, which made him tease even little Gerda, whose<br>
whole soul was devoted to him.<br>
<br>
His games now were quite different to what they had formerly been, they<br>
were so very knowing. One winter's day, when the flakes of snow were<br>
flying about, he spread the skirts of his blue coat, and caught the snow<br>
as it fell.<br>
<br>
"Look through this glass, Gerda," said he. And every flake seemed<br>
larger, and appeared like a magnificent flower, or beautiful star; it<br>
was splendid to look at!<br>
<br>
"Look, how clever!" said Kay. "That's much more interesting than
real<br>
flowers! They are as exact as possible; there is not a fault in them, if<br>
they did not melt!"<br>
<br>
It was not long after this, that Kay came one day with large gloves on,<br>
and his little sledge at his back, and bawled right into Gerda's ears,<br>
"I have permission to go out into the square where the others are<br>
playing"; and off he was in a moment.<br>
<br>
There, in the market-place, some of the boldest of the boys used to tie<br>
their sledges to the carts as they passed by, and so they were pulled<br>
along, and got a good ride. It was so capital! Just as they were in the<br>
very height of their amusement, a large sledge passed by: it was painted<br>
quite white, and there was someone in it wrapped up in a rough white<br>
mantle of fur, with a rough white fur cap on his head. The sledge drove<br>
round the square twice, and Kay tied on his sledge as quickly as he<br>
could, and off he drove with it. On they went quicker and quicker into<br>
the next street; and the person who drove turned round to Kay, and<br>
nodded to him in a friendly manner, just as if they knew each other.<br>
Every time he was going to untie his sledge, the person nodded to him,<br>
and then Kay sat quiet; and so on they went till they came outside<br>
the gates of the town. Then the snow began to fall so thickly that the<br>
little boy could not see an arm's length before him, but still on he<br>
went: when suddenly he let go the string he held in his hand in order<br>
to get loose from the sledge, but it was of no use; still the little<br>
vehicle rushed on with the quickness of the wind. He then cried as loud<br>
as he could, but no one heard him; the snow drifted and the sledge flew<br>
on, and sometimes it gave a jerk as though they were driving over hedges<br>
and ditches. He was quite frightened, and he tried to repeat the<br>
Lord's Prayer; but all he could do, he was only able to remember the<br>
multiplication table.<br>
<br>
The snow-flakes grew larger and larger, till at last they looked just<br>
like great white fowls. Suddenly they flew on one side; the large sledge<br>
stopped, and the person who drove rose up. It was a lady; her cloak and<br>
cap were of snow. She was tall and of slender figure, and of a dazzling<br>
whiteness. It was the Snow Queen.<br>
<br>
"We have travelled fast," said she; "but it is freezingly cold.
Come<br>
under my bearskin." And she put him in the sledge beside her,<br>
wrapped the fur round him, and he felt as though he were sinking in a<br>
snow-wreath.<br>
<br>
"Are you still cold?" asked she; and then she kissed his forehead.<br>
Ah! it was colder than ice; it penetrated to his very heart, which was<br>
already almost a frozen lump; it seemed to him as if he were about to<br>
die--but a moment more and it was quite congenial to him, and he did not<br>
remark the cold that was around him.<br>
<br>
"My sledge! Do not forget my sledge!" It was the first thing he
thought<br>
of. It was there tied to one of the white chickens, who flew along with<br>
it on his back behind the large sledge. The Snow Queen kissed Kay once<br>
more, and then he forgot little Gerda, grandmother, and all whom he had<br>
left at his home.<br>
<br>
"Now you will have no more kisses," said she, "or else I should
kiss you<br>
to death!"<br>
<br>
Kay looked at her. She was very beautiful; a more clever, or a more<br>
lovely countenance he could not fancy to himself; and she no longer<br>
appeared of ice as before, when she sat outside the window, and beckoned<br>
to him; in his eyes she was perfect, he did not fear her at all, and<br>
told her that he could calculate in his head and with fractions, even;<br>
that he knew the number of square miles there were in the different<br>
countries, and how many inhabitants they contained; and she smiled while<br>
he spoke. It then seemed to him as if what he knew was not enough, and<br>
he looked upwards in the large huge empty space above him, and on she<br>
flew with him; flew high over the black clouds, while the storm moaned<br>
and whistled as though it were singing some old tune. On they flew<br>
over woods and lakes, over seas, and many lands; and beneath them the<br>
chilling storm rushed fast, the wolves howled, the snow crackled; above<br>
them flew large screaming crows, but higher up appeared the moon, quite<br>
large and bright; and it was on it that Kay gazed during the long long<br>
winter's night; while by day he slept at the feet of the Snow Queen.<br>

        <p>1. The two children had a garden that was larger than a flower-pot. It consisted of wooden boxes filled with vegetables and rose-trees. The boxes were placed across the gutter between their windows, forming walls of flowers. In the summer, the garden was a delightful place for the children to play, and in winter, they could still enjoy it by looking through a peep-hole in the frozen window.</p>
        <p>2. After tying his sled to the large sledge in the market square, the sledge, driven by a person wrapped in a rough white mantle, started moving rapidly. Despite Kay's attempts to untie his sled, it continued to speed up and eventually went beyond the town gates. The snowfall became thick, and Kay couldn't see far ahead. He tried to call for help, but no one heard him. The snowflakes grew larger, and the sledge finally stopped. The person driving the sledge, revealed to be the Snow Queen, invited Kay under her bearskin for warmth. The sledge, tied to a white chicken, followed behind as they continued their journey.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>THIRD STORY. Of the Flower-Garden At the Old Woman's Who Understood Witchcraft</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
But what became of little Gerda when Kay did not return? Where could he<br>
be? Nobody knew; nobody could give any intelligence. All the boys knew<br>
was, that they had seen him tie his sledge to another large and splendid<br>
one, which drove down the street and out of the town. Nobody knew<br>
where he was; many sad tears were shed, and little Gerda wept long and<br>
bitterly; at last she said he must be dead; that he had been drowned in<br>
the river which flowed close to the town. Oh! those were very long and<br>
dismal winter evenings!<br>
<br>
At last spring came, with its warm sunshine.<br>
<br>
"Kay is dead and gone!" said little Gerda.<br>
<br>
"That I don't believe," said the Sunshine.<br>
<br>
"Kay is dead and gone!" said she to the Swallows.<br>
<br>
"That I don't believe," said they: and at last little Gerda did not<br>
think so any longer either.<br>
<br>
"I'll put on my red shoes," said she, one morning; "Kay has
never seen<br>
them, and then I'll go down to the river and ask there."<br>
<br>
It was quite early; she kissed her old grandmother, who was still<br>
asleep, put on her red shoes, and went alone to the river.<br>
<br>
"Is it true that you have taken my little playfellow? I will make you a<br>
present of my red shoes, if you will give him back to me."<br>
<br>
And, as it seemed to her, the blue waves nodded in a strange manner;<br>
then she took off her red shoes, the most precious things she possessed,<br>
and threw them both into the river. But they fell close to the bank, and<br>
the little waves bore them immediately to land; it was as if the stream<br>
would not take what was dearest to her; for in reality it had not got<br>
little Kay; but Gerda thought that she had not thrown the shoes out far<br>
enough, so she clambered into a boat which lay among the rushes, went<br>
to the farthest end, and threw out the shoes. But the boat was not<br>
fastened, and the motion which she occasioned, made it drift from the<br>
shore. She observed this, and hastened to get back; but before she could<br>
do so, the boat was more than a yard from the land, and was gliding<br>
quickly onward.<br>
<br>
Little Gerda was very frightened, and began to cry; but no one heard her<br>
except the sparrows, and they could not carry her to land; but they flew<br>
along the bank, and sang as if to comfort her, "Here we are! Here we<br>
are!" The boat drifted with the stream, little Gerda sat quite still<br>
without shoes, for they were swimming behind the boat, but she could not<br>
reach them, because the boat went much faster than they did.<br>
<br>
The banks on both sides were beautiful; lovely flowers, venerable trees,<br>
and slopes with sheep and cows, but not a human being was to be seen.<br>
<br>
"Perhaps the river will carry me to little Kay," said she; and then<br>
she grew less sad. She rose, and looked for many hours at the beautiful<br>
green banks. Presently she sailed by a large cherry-orchard, where was<br>
a little cottage with curious red and blue windows; it was thatched,<br>
and before it two wooden soldiers stood sentry, and presented arms when<br>
anyone went past.<br>
<br>
Gerda called to them, for she thought they were alive; but they, of<br>
course, did not answer. She came close to them, for the stream drifted<br>
the boat quite near the land.<br>
<br>
Gerda called still louder, and an old woman then came out of the<br>
cottage, leaning upon a crooked stick. She had a large broad-brimmed hat<br>
on, painted with the most splendid flowers.<br>
<br>
"Poor little child!" said the old woman. "How did you get upon
the large<br>
rapid river, to be driven about so in the wide world!" And then the<br>
old woman went into the water, caught hold of the boat with her crooked<br>
stick, drew it to the bank, and lifted little Gerda out.<br>
<br>
And Gerda was so glad to be on dry land again; but she was rather afraid<br>
of the strange old woman.<br>
<br>
"But come and tell me who you are, and how you came here," said she.<br>
<br>
And Gerda told her all; and the old woman shook her head and said,<br>
"A-hem! a-hem!" and when Gerda had told her everything, and asked her
if<br>
she had not seen little Kay, the woman answered that he had not passed<br>
there, but he no doubt would come; and she told her not to be cast down,<br>
but taste her cherries, and look at her flowers, which were finer than<br>
any in a picture-book, each of which could tell a whole story. She then<br>
took Gerda by the hand, led her into the little cottage, and locked the<br>
door.<br>
<br>
The windows were very high up; the glass was red, blue, and green, and<br>
the sunlight shone through quite wondrously in all sorts of colors. On<br>
the table stood the most exquisite cherries, and Gerda ate as many as<br>
she chose, for she had permission to do so. While she was eating, the<br>
old woman combed her hair with a golden comb, and her hair curled and<br>
shone with a lovely golden color around that sweet little face, which<br>
was so round and so like a rose.<br>
<br>
"I have often longed for such a dear little girl," said the old
woman.<br>
"Now you shall see how well we agree together"; and while she combed<br>
little Gerda's hair, the child forgot her foster-brother Kay more and<br>
more, for the old woman understood magic; but she was no evil being, she<br>
only practised witchcraft a little for her own private amusement, and<br>
now she wanted very much to keep little Gerda. She therefore went out<br>
in the garden, stretched out her crooked stick towards the rose-bushes,<br>
which, beautifully as they were blowing, all sank into the earth and no<br>
one could tell where they had stood. The old woman feared that if Gerda<br>
should see the roses, she would then think of her own, would remember<br>
little Kay, and run away from her.<br>
<br>
She now led Gerda into the flower-garden. Oh, what odour and what<br>
loveliness was there! Every flower that one could think of, and of every<br>
season, stood there in fullest bloom; no picture-book could be gayer or<br>
more beautiful. Gerda jumped for joy, and played till the sun set behind<br>
the tall cherry-tree; she then had a pretty bed, with a red silken<br>
coverlet filled with blue violets. She fell asleep, and had as pleasant<br>
dreams as ever a queen on her wedding-day.<br>
<br>
The next morning she went to play with the flowers in the warm sunshine,<br>
and thus passed away a day. Gerda knew every flower; and, numerous as<br>
they were, it still seemed to Gerda that one was wanting, though she<br>
did not know which. One day while she was looking at the hat of the old<br>
woman painted with flowers, the most beautiful of them all seemed to her<br>
to be a rose. The old woman had forgotten to take it from her hat<br>
when she made the others vanish in the earth. But so it is when one's<br>
thoughts are not collected. "What!" said Gerda. "Are there no
roses<br>
here?" and she ran about amongst the flowerbeds, and looked, and looked,<br>
but there was not one to be found. She then sat down and wept; but her<br>
hot tears fell just where a rose-bush had sunk; and when her warm tears<br>
watered the ground, the tree shot up suddenly as fresh and blooming as<br>
when it had been swallowed up. Gerda kissed the roses, thought of her<br>
own dear roses at home, and with them of little Kay.<br>
<br>
"Oh, how long I have stayed!" said the little girl. "I intended
to look<br>
for Kay! Don't you know where he is?" she asked of the roses. "Do you<br>
think he is dead and gone?"<br>
<br>
"Dead he certainly is not," said the Roses. "We have been in the
earth<br>
where all the dead are, but Kay was not there."<br>
<br>
"Many thanks!" said little Gerda; and she went to the other flowers,<br>
looked into their cups, and asked, "Don't you know where little Kay
is?"<br>
<br>
But every flower stood in the sunshine, and dreamed its own fairy tale<br>
or its own story: and they all told her very many things, but not one<br>
knew anything of Kay.<br>
<br>
Well, what did the Tiger-Lily say?<br>
<br>
"Hearest thou not the drum? Bum! Bum! Those are the only two tones.<br>
Always bum! Bum! Hark to the plaintive song of the old woman, to the<br>
call of the priests! The Hindoo woman in her long robe stands upon the<br>
funeral pile; the flames rise around her and her dead husband, but the<br>
Hindoo woman thinks on the living one in the surrounding circle; on him<br>
whose eyes burn hotter than the flames--on him, the fire of whose eyes<br>
pierces her heart more than the flames which soon will burn her body to<br>
ashes. Can the heart's flame die in the flame of the funeral pile?"<br>
<br>
"I don't understand that at all," said little Gerda.<br>
<br>
"That is my story," said the Lily.<br>
<br>
What did the Convolvulus say?<br>
<br>
"Projecting over a narrow mountain-path there hangs an old feudal<br>
castle. Thick evergreens grow on the dilapidated walls, and around the<br>
altar, where a lovely maiden is standing: she bends over the railing and<br>
looks out upon the rose. No fresher rose hangs on the branches than she;<br>
no appleblossom carried away by the wind is more buoyant! How her silken<br>
robe is rustling!<br>
<br>
"'Is he not yet come?'"<br>
<br>
"Is it Kay that you mean?" asked little Gerda.<br>
<br>
"I am speaking about my story--about my dream," answered the<br>
Convolvulus.<br>
<br>
What did the Snowdrops say?<br>
<br>
"Between the trees a long board is hanging--it is a swing. Two little<br>
girls are sitting in it, and swing themselves backwards and forwards;<br>
their frocks are as white as snow, and long green silk ribands flutter<br>
from their bonnets. Their brother, who is older than they are, stands up<br>
in the swing; he twines his arms round the cords to hold himself fast,<br>
for in one hand he has a little cup, and in the other a clay-pipe. He is<br>
blowing soap-bubbles. The swing moves, and the bubbles float in charming<br>
changing colors: the last is still hanging to the end of the pipe, and<br>
rocks in the breeze. The swing moves. The little black dog, as light as<br>
a soap-bubble, jumps up on his hind legs to try to get into the swing.<br>
It moves, the dog falls down, barks, and is angry. They tease him; the<br>
bubble bursts! A swing, a bursting bubble--such is my song!"<br>
<br>
"What you relate may be very pretty, but you tell it in so melancholy a<br>
manner, and do not mention Kay."<br>
<br>
What do the Hyacinths say?<br>
<br>
"There were once upon a time three sisters, quite transparent, and very<br>
beautiful. The robe of the one was red, that of the second blue, and<br>
that of the third white. They danced hand in hand beside the calm<br>
lake in the clear moonshine. They were not elfin maidens, but mortal<br>
children. A sweet fragrance was smelt, and the maidens vanished in the<br>
wood; the fragrance grew stronger--three coffins, and in them three<br>
lovely maidens, glided out of the forest and across the lake: the<br>
shining glow-worms flew around like little floating lights. Do the<br>
dancing maidens sleep, or are they dead? The odour of the flowers says<br>
they are corpses; the evening bell tolls for the dead!"<br>
<br>
"You make me quite sad," said little Gerda. "I cannot help
thinking of<br>
the dead maidens. Oh! is little Kay really dead? The Roses have been in<br>
the earth, and they say no."<br>
<br>
"Ding, dong!" sounded the Hyacinth bells. "We do not toll for
little<br>
Kay; we do not know him. That is our way of singing, the only one we<br>
have."<br>
<br>
And Gerda went to the Ranunculuses, that looked forth from among the<br>
shining green leaves.<br>
<br>
"You are a little bright sun!" said Gerda. "Tell me if you know
where I<br>
can find my playfellow."<br>
<br>
And the Ranunculus shone brightly, and looked again at Gerda. What<br>
song could the Ranunculus sing? It was one that said nothing about Kay<br>
either.<br>
<br>
"In a small court the bright sun was shining in the first days of<br>
spring. The beams glided down the white walls of a neighbor's house, and<br>
close by the fresh yellow flowers were growing, shining like gold in<br>
the warm sun-rays. An old grandmother was sitting in the air; her<br>
grand-daughter, the poor and lovely servant just come for a short visit.<br>
She knows her grandmother. There was gold, pure virgin gold in that<br>
blessed kiss. There, that is my little story," said the Ranunculus.<br>
<br>
"My poor old grandmother!" sighed Gerda. "Yes, she is longing
for me,<br>
no doubt: she is sorrowing for me, as she did for little Kay. But I<br>
will soon come home, and then I will bring Kay with me. It is of no use<br>
asking the flowers; they only know their own old rhymes, and can tell me<br>
nothing." And she tucked up her frock, to enable her to run quicker; but<br>
the Narcissus gave her a knock on the leg, just as she was going to<br>
jump over it. So she stood still, looked at the long yellow flower, and<br>
asked, "You perhaps know something?" and she bent down to the
Narcissus.<br>
And what did it say?<br>
<br>
"I can see myself--I can see myself! Oh, how odorous I am! Up in the<br>
little garret there stands, half-dressed, a little Dancer. She stands<br>
now on one leg, now on both; she despises the whole world; yet she lives<br>
only in imagination. She pours water out of the teapot over a piece of<br>
stuff which she holds in her hand; it is the bodice; cleanliness is a<br>
fine thing. The white dress is hanging on the hook; it was washed in the<br>
teapot, and dried on the roof. She puts it on, ties a saffron-colored<br>
kerchief round her neck, and then the gown looks whiter. I can see<br>
myself--I can see myself!"<br>
<br>
"That's nothing to me," said little Gerda. "That does not
concern me."<br>
And then off she ran to the further end of the garden.<br>
<br>
The gate was locked, but she shook the rusted bolt till it was loosened,<br>
and the gate opened; and little Gerda ran off barefooted into the wide<br>
world. She looked round her thrice, but no one followed her. At last she<br>
could run no longer; she sat down on a large stone, and when she looked<br>
about her, she saw that the summer had passed; it was late in the<br>
autumn, but that one could not remark in the beautiful garden, where<br>
there was always sunshine, and where there were flowers the whole year<br>
round.<br>
<br>
"Dear me, how long I have staid!" said Gerda. "Autumn is come. I
must<br>
not rest any longer." And she got up to go further.<br>
<br>
Oh, how tender and wearied her little feet were! All around it looked<br>
so cold and raw: the long willow-leaves were quite yellow, and the fog<br>
dripped from them like water; one leaf fell after the other: the sloes<br>
only stood full of fruit, which set one's teeth on edge. Oh, how dark<br>
and comfortless it was in the dreary world!<br>

        <p>1. Gerda put on her red shoes, which Kay had never seen, and went to the river. She asked the river if it had taken her playfellow, offering her red shoes as a gift in exchange for information. When the river did not respond, she threw her red shoes into the water, thinking it might help locate Kay.</p>
        <p>2. When Gerda wept near a rose-bush, her hot tears fell where the rose-bush had sunk. The warmth of her tears caused the rose-bush to shoot up suddenly, blooming fresh and beautiful. Gerda kissed the roses, thinking of her own dear roses at home and of little Kay.</p>
        <p>3. The Narcissus did not provide any helpful information about Kay. Instead, it described a scene of a little Dancer in a garret, half-dressed, washing her dress in a teapot and imagining herself living in cleanliness and beauty. Gerda found this irrelevant and continued her search.</p>

    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
Gerda was obliged to rest herself again, when, exactly opposite to her,<br>
a large Raven came hopping over the white snow. He had long been looking<br>
at Gerda and shaking his head; and now he said, "Caw! Caw!" Good day!<br>
Good day! He could not say it better; but he felt a sympathy for the<br>
little girl, and asked her where she was going all alone. The word<br>
"alone" Gerda understood quite well, and felt how much was expressed<br>
by it; so she told the Raven her whole history, and asked if he had not<br>
seen Kay.<br>
<br>
The Raven nodded very gravely, and said, "It may be--it may be!"<br>
<br>
"What, do you really think so?" cried the little girl; and she nearly<br>
squeezed the Raven to death, so much did she kiss him.<br>
<br>
"Gently, gently," said the Raven. "I think I know; I think that
it may<br>
be little Kay. But now he has forgotten you for the Princess."<br>
<br>
"Does he live with a Princess?" asked Gerda.<br>
<br>
"Yes--listen," said the Raven; "but it will be difficult for me
to<br>
speak your language. If you understand the Raven language I can tell you<br>
better."<br>
<br>
"No, I have not learnt it," said Gerda; "but my grandmother
understands<br>
it, and she can speak gibberish too. I wish I had learnt it."<br>
<br>
"No matter," said the Raven; "I will tell you as well as I can;
however,<br>
it will be bad enough." And then he told all he knew.<br>
<br>
"In the kingdom where we now are there lives a Princess, who is<br>
extraordinarily clever; for she has read all the newspapers in the whole<br>
world, and has forgotten them again--so clever is she. She was lately,<br>
it is said, sitting on her throne--which is not very amusing after<br>
all--when she began humming an old tune, and it was just, 'Oh, why<br>
should I not be married?' 'That song is not without its meaning,' said<br>
she, and so then she was determined to marry; but she would have a<br>
husband who knew how to give an answer when he was spoken to--not<br>
one who looked only as if he were a great personage, for that is so<br>
tiresome. She then had all the ladies of the court drummed together; and<br>
when they heard her intention, all were very pleased, and said, 'We are<br>
very glad to hear it; it is the very thing we were thinking of.' You may<br>
believe every word I say," said the Raven; "for I have a tame
sweetheart<br>
that hops about in the palace quite free, and it was she who told me all<br>
this.<br>
<br>
"The newspapers appeared forthwith with a border of hearts and the<br>
initials of the Princess; and therein you might read that every<br>
good-looking young man was at liberty to come to the palace and speak to<br>
the Princess; and he who spoke in such wise as showed he felt himself at<br>
home there, that one the Princess would choose for her husband.<br>
<br>
"Yes, Yes," said the Raven, "you may believe it; it is as true
as I am<br>
sitting here. People came in crowds; there was a crush and a hurry, but<br>
no one was successful either on the first or second day. They could all<br>
talk well enough when they were out in the street; but as soon as<br>
they came inside the palace gates, and saw the guard richly dressed<br>
in silver, and the lackeys in gold on the staircase, and the large<br>
illuminated saloons, then they were abashed; and when they stood before<br>
the throne on which the Princess was sitting, all they could do was<br>
to repeat the last word they had uttered, and to hear it again did not<br>
interest her very much. It was just as if the people within were under<br>
a charm, and had fallen into a trance till they came out again into the<br>
street; for then--oh, then--they could chatter enough. There was a whole<br>
row of them standing from the town-gates to the palace. I was there<br>
myself to look," said the Raven. "They grew hungry and thirsty; but
from<br>
the palace they got nothing whatever, not even a glass of water. Some<br>
of the cleverest, it is true, had taken bread and butter with them:<br>
but none shared it with his neighbor, for each thought, 'Let him look<br>
hungry, and then the Princess won't have him.'"<br>
<br>
"But Kay--little Kay," said Gerda, "when did he come? Was he
among the<br>
number?"<br>
<br>
"Patience, patience; we are just come to him. It was on the third day<br>
when a little personage without horse or equipage, came marching right<br>
boldly up to the palace; his eyes shone like yours, he had beautiful<br>
long hair, but his clothes were very shabby."<br>
<br>
"That was Kay," cried Gerda, with a voice of delight. "Oh, now
I've<br>
found him!" and she clapped her hands for joy.<br>
<br>
"He had a little knapsack at his back," said the Raven.<br>
<br>
"No, that was certainly his sledge," said Gerda; "for when he
went away<br>
he took his sledge with him."<br>
<br>
"That may be," said the Raven; "I did not examine him so
minutely; but<br>
I know from my tame sweetheart, that when he came into the court-yard<br>
of the palace, and saw the body-guard in silver, the lackeys on the<br>
staircase, he was not the least abashed; he nodded, and said to them,<br>
'It must be very tiresome to stand on the stairs; for my part, I shall<br>
go in.' The saloons were gleaming with lustres--privy councillors and<br>
excellencies were walking about barefooted, and wore gold keys; it was<br>
enough to make any one feel uncomfortable. His boots creaked, too, so<br>
loudly, but still he was not at all afraid."<br>
<br>
"That's Kay for certain," said Gerda. "I know he had on new
boots; I<br>
have heard them creaking in grandmama's room."<br>
<br>
"Yes, they creaked," said the Raven. "And on he went boldly up
to the<br>
Princess, who was sitting on a pearl as large as a spinning-wheel.<br>
All the ladies of the court, with their attendants and attendants'<br>
attendants, and all the cavaliers, with their gentlemen and gentlemen's<br>
gentlemen, stood round; and the nearer they stood to the door, the<br>
prouder they looked. It was hardly possible to look at the gentleman's<br>
gentleman, so very haughtily did he stand in the doorway."<br>
<br>
"It must have been terrible," said little Gerda. "And did Kay
get the<br>
Princess?"<br>
<br>
"Were I not a Raven, I should have taken the Princess myself, although<br>
I am promised. It is said he spoke as well as I speak when I talk Raven<br>
language; this I learned from my tame sweetheart. He was bold and nicely<br>
behaved; he had not come to woo the Princess, but only to hear her<br>
wisdom. She pleased him, and he pleased her."<br>
<br>
"Yes, yes; for certain that was Kay," said Gerda. "He was so
clever;<br>
he could reckon fractions in his head. Oh, won't you take me to the<br>
palace?"<br>
<br>
"That is very easily said," answered the Raven. "But how are we
to<br>
manage it? I'll speak to my tame sweetheart about it: she must advise<br>
us; for so much I must tell you, such a little girl as you are will<br>
never get permission to enter."<br>
<br>
"Oh, yes I shall," said Gerda; "when Kay hears that I am here,
he will<br>
come out directly to fetch me."<br>
<br>
"Wait for me here on these steps," said the Raven. He moved his head<br>
backwards and forwards and flew away.<br>
<br>
The evening was closing in when the Raven returned. "Caw--caw!" said
he.<br>
"She sends you her compliments; and here is a roll for you. She took<br>
it out of the kitchen, where there is bread enough. You are hungry,<br>
no doubt. It is not possible for you to enter the palace, for you are<br>
barefooted: the guards in silver, and the lackeys in gold, would not<br>
allow it; but do not cry, you shall come in still. My sweetheart knows a<br>
little back stair that leads to the bedchamber, and she knows where she<br>
can get the key of it."<br>
<br>
And they went into the garden in the large avenue, where one leaf was<br>
falling after the other; and when the lights in the palace had all<br>
gradually disappeared, the Raven led little Gerda to the back door,<br>
which stood half open.<br>
<br>
Oh, how Gerda's heart beat with anxiety and longing! It was just as if<br>
she had been about to do something wrong; and yet she only wanted to<br>
know if little Kay was there. Yes, he must be there. She called to mind<br>
his intelligent eyes, and his long hair, so vividly, she could quite see<br>
him as he used to laugh when they were sitting under the roses at home.<br>
"He will, no doubt, be glad to see you--to hear what a long way you have<br>
come for his sake; to know how unhappy all at home were when he did not<br>
come back."<br>
<br>
Oh, what a fright and a joy it was!<br>
<br>
They were now on the stairs. A single lamp was burning there; and on the<br>
floor stood the tame Raven, turning her head on every side and looking<br>
at Gerda, who bowed as her grandmother had taught her to do.<br>
<br>
"My intended has told me so much good of you, my dear young lady,"
said<br>
the tame Raven. "Your tale is very affecting. If you will take the lamp,<br>
I will go before. We will go straight on, for we shall meet no one."<br>
<br>
"I think there is somebody just behind us," said Gerda; and something<br>
rushed past: it was like shadowy figures on the wall; horses with<br>
flowing manes and thin legs, huntsmen, ladies and gentlemen on<br>
horseback.<br>
<br>
"They are only dreams," said the Raven. "They come to fetch the
thoughts<br>
of the high personages to the chase; 'tis well, for now you can observe<br>
them in bed all the better. But let me find, when you enjoy honor and<br>
distinction, that you possess a grateful heart."<br>
<br>
"Tut! That's not worth talking about," said the Raven of the woods.<br>
<br>
They now entered the first saloon, which was of rose-colored satin, with<br>
artificial flowers on the wall. Here the dreams were rushing past,<br>
but they hastened by so quickly that Gerda could not see the high<br>
personages. One hall was more magnificent than the other; one might<br>
indeed well be abashed; and at last they came into the bedchamber. The<br>
ceiling of the room resembled a large palm-tree with leaves of glass,<br>
of costly glass; and in the middle, from a thick golden stem, hung two<br>
beds, each of which resembled a lily. One was white, and in this lay the<br>
Princess; the other was red, and it was here that Gerda was to look for<br>
little Kay. She bent back one of the red leaves, and saw a brown neck.<br>
Oh! that was Kay! She called him quite loud by name, held the lamp<br>
towards him--the dreams rushed back again into the chamber--he awoke,<br>
turned his head, and--it was not little Kay!<br>
<br>
The Prince was only like him about the neck; but he was young and<br>
handsome. And out of the white lily leaves the Princess peeped, too,<br>
and asked what was the matter. Then little Gerda cried, and told her her<br>
whole history, and all that the Ravens had done for her.<br>
<br>
"Poor little thing!" said the Prince and the Princess. They praised
the<br>
Ravens very much, and told them they were not at all angry with them,<br>
but they were not to do so again. However, they should have a reward.<br>
"Will you fly about here at liberty," asked the Princess; "or
would you<br>
like to have a fixed appointment as court ravens, with all the broken<br>
bits from the kitchen?"<br>
<br>
And both the Ravens nodded, and begged for a fixed appointment; for<br>
they thought of their old age, and said, "It is a good thing to have a<br>
provision for our old days."<br>
<br>
And the Prince got up and let Gerda sleep in his bed, and more than this<br>
he could not do. She folded her little hands and thought, "How good men<br>
and animals are!" and she then fell asleep and slept soundly. All the<br>
dreams flew in again, and they now looked like the angels; they drew<br>
a little sledge, in which little Kay sat and nodded his head; but the<br>
whole was only a dream, and therefore it all vanished as soon as she<br>
awoke.<br>
<br>
The next day she was dressed from head to foot in silk and velvet. They<br>
offered to let her stay at the palace, and lead a happy life; but she<br>
begged to have a little carriage with a horse in front, and for a small<br>
pair of shoes; then, she said, she would again go forth in the wide<br>
world and look for Kay.<br>
<br>
Shoes and a muff were given her; she was, too, dressed very nicely; and<br>
when she was about to set off, a new carriage stopped before the door.<br>
It was of pure gold, and the arms of the Prince and Princess shone<br>
like a star upon it; the coachman, the footmen, and the outriders, for<br>
outriders were there, too, all wore golden crowns. The Prince and the<br>
Princess assisted her into the carriage themselves, and wished her all<br>
success. The Raven of the woods, who was now married, accompanied her<br>
for the first three miles. He sat beside Gerda, for he could not bear<br>
riding backwards; the other Raven stood in the doorway, and flapped her<br>
wings; she could not accompany Gerda, because she suffered from headache<br>
since she had had a fixed appointment and ate so much. The carriage<br>
was lined inside with sugar-plums, and in the seats were fruits and<br>
gingerbread.<br>
<br>
"Farewell! Farewell!" cried Prince and Princess; and Gerda wept, and<br>
the Raven wept. Thus passed the first miles; and then the Raven bade her<br>
farewell, and this was the most painful separation of all. He flew into<br>
a tree, and beat his black wings as long as he could see the carriage,<br>
that shone from afar like a sunbeam.<br>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>FIFTH STORY. The Little Robber Maiden</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
They drove through the dark wood; but the carriage shone like a torch,<br>
and it dazzled the eyes of the robbers, so that they could not bear to<br>
look at it.<br>
<br>
"'Tis gold! 'Tis gold!" they cried; and they rushed forward, seized<br>
the horses, knocked down the little postilion, the coachman, and the<br>
servants, and pulled little Gerda out of the carriage.<br>
<br>
"How plump, how beautiful she is! She must have been fed on<br>
nut-kernels," said the old female robber, who had a long, scrubby beard,<br>
and bushy eyebrows that hung down over her eyes. "She is as good as a<br>
fatted lamb! How nice she will be!" And then she drew out a knife, the<br>
blade of which shone so that it was quite dreadful to behold.<br>
<br>
"Oh!" cried the woman at the same moment. She had been bitten in the
ear<br>
by her own little daughter, who hung at her back; and who was so wild<br>
and unmanageable, that it was quite amusing to see her. "You naughty<br>
child!" said the mother: and now she had not time to kill Gerda.<br>
<br>
"She shall play with me," said the little robber child. "She
shall give<br>
me her muff, and her pretty frock; she shall sleep in my bed!" And then<br>
she gave her mother another bite, so that she jumped, and ran round with<br>
the pain; and the Robbers laughed, and said, "Look, how she is dancing<br>
with the little one!"<br>
<br>
"I will go into the carriage," said the little robber maiden; and she<br>
would have her will, for she was very spoiled and very headstrong. She<br>
and Gerda got in; and then away they drove over the stumps of felled<br>
trees, deeper and deeper into the woods. The little robber maiden was as<br>
tall as Gerda, but stronger, broader-shouldered, and of dark complexion;<br>
her eyes were quite black; they looked almost melancholy. She embraced<br>
little Gerda, and said, "They shall not kill you as long as I am not<br>
displeased with you. You are, doubtless, a Princess?"<br>
<br>
"No," said little Gerda; who then related all that had happened to
her,<br>
and how much she cared about little Kay.<br>
<br>
The little robber maiden looked at her with a serious air, nodded her<br>
head slightly, and said, "They shall not kill you, even if I am angry<br>
with you: then I will do it myself"; and she dried Gerda's eyes, and put<br>
both her hands in the handsome muff, which was so soft and warm.<br>
<br>
At length the carriage stopped. They were in the midst of the court-yard<br>
of a robber's castle. It was full of cracks from top to bottom; and out<br>
of the openings magpies and rooks were flying; and the great bull-dogs,<br>
each of which looked as if he could swallow a man, jumped up, but they<br>
did not bark, for that was forbidden.<br>
<br>
In the midst of the large, old, smoking hall burnt a great fire on the<br>
stone floor. The smoke disappeared under the stones, and had to seek<br>
its own egress. In an immense caldron soup was boiling; and rabbits and<br>
hares were being roasted on a spit.<br>
<br>
"You shall sleep with me to-night, with all my animals," said the
little<br>
robber maiden. They had something to eat and drink; and then went into<br>
a corner, where straw and carpets were lying. Beside them, on laths and<br>
perches, sat nearly a hundred pigeons, all asleep, seemingly; but yet<br>
they moved a little when the robber maiden came. "They are all mine,"<br>
said she, at the same time seizing one that was next to her by the legs<br>
and shaking it so that its wings fluttered. "Kiss it," cried the
little<br>
girl, and flung the pigeon in Gerda's face. "Up there is the rabble of<br>
the wood," continued she, pointing to several laths which were fastened<br>
before a hole high up in the wall; "that's the rabble; they would all<br>
fly away immediately, if they were not well fastened in. And here is my<br>
dear old Bac"; and she laid hold of the horns of a reindeer, that had a<br>
bright copper ring round its neck, and was tethered to the spot. "We are<br>
obliged to lock this fellow in too, or he would make his escape. Every<br>
evening I tickle his neck with my sharp knife; he is so frightened at<br>
it!" and the little girl drew forth a long knife, from a crack in the<br>
wall, and let it glide over the Reindeer's neck. The poor animal kicked;<br>
the girl laughed, and pulled Gerda into bed with her.<br>
<br>
"Do you intend to keep your knife while you sleep?" asked Gerda;
looking<br>
at it rather fearfully.<br>
<br>
"I always sleep with the knife," said the little robber maiden.
"There<br>
is no knowing what may happen. But tell me now, once more, all about<br>
little Kay; and why you have started off in the wide world alone." And<br>
Gerda related all, from the very beginning: the Wood-pigeons cooed above<br>
in their cage, and the others slept. The little robber maiden wound her<br>
arm round Gerda's neck, held the knife in the other hand, and snored so<br>
loud that everybody could hear her; but Gerda could not close her eyes,<br>
for she did not know whether she was to live or die. The robbers sat<br>
round the fire, sang and drank; and the old female robber jumped about<br>
so, that it was quite dreadful for Gerda to see her.<br>
<br>
Then the Wood-pigeons said, "Coo! Coo! We have seen little Kay! A white<br>
hen carries his sledge; he himself sat in the carriage of the Snow<br>
Queen, who passed here, down just over the wood, as we lay in our nest.<br>
She blew upon us young ones; and all died except we two. Coo! Coo!"<br>
<br>
"What is that you say up there?" cried little Gerda. "Where did
the Snow<br>
Queen go to? Do you know anything about it?"<br>
<br>
"She is no doubt gone to Lapland; for there is always snow and ice<br>
there. Only ask the Reindeer, who is tethered there."<br>
<br>
"Ice and snow is there! There it is, glorious and beautiful!" said
the<br>
Reindeer. "One can spring about in the large shining valleys! The Snow<br>
Queen has her summer-tent there; but her fixed abode is high up towards<br>
the North Pole, on the Island called Spitzbergen."<br>
<br>
"Oh, Kay! Poor little Kay!" sighed Gerda.<br>
<br>
"Do you choose to be quiet?" said the robber maiden. "If you
don't, I<br>
shall make you."<br>
<br>
In the morning Gerda told her all that the Wood-pigeons had said; and<br>
the little maiden looked very serious, but she nodded her head, and<br>
said, "That's no matter--that's no matter. Do you know where Lapland<br>
lies!" she asked of the Reindeer.<br>
<br>
"Who should know better than I?" said the animal; and his eyes rolled
in<br>
his head. "I was born and bred there--there I leapt about on the fields<br>
of snow."<br>
<br>
"Listen," said the robber maiden to Gerda. "You see that the men
are<br>
gone; but my mother is still here, and will remain. However, towards<br>
morning she takes a draught out of the large flask, and then she sleeps<br>
a little: then I will do something for you." She now jumped out of bed,<br>
flew to her mother; with her arms round her neck, and pulling her by the<br>
beard, said, "Good morrow, my own sweet nanny-goat of a mother." And
her<br>
mother took hold of her nose, and pinched it till it was red and blue;<br>
but this was all done out of pure love.<br>
<br>
When the mother had taken a sup at her flask, and was having a nap, the<br>
little robber maiden went to the Reindeer, and said, "I should very much<br>
like to give you still many a tickling with the sharp knife, for then<br>
you are so amusing; however, I will untether you, and help you out,<br>
so that you may go back to Lapland. But you must make good use of your<br>
legs; and take this little girl for me to the palace of the Snow Queen,<br>
where her playfellow is. You have heard, I suppose, all she said; for<br>
she spoke loud enough, and you were listening."<br>
<br>
The Reindeer gave a bound for joy. The robber maiden lifted up little<br>
Gerda, and took the precaution to bind her fast on the Reindeer's back;<br>
she even gave her a small cushion to sit on. "Here are your worsted<br>
leggins, for it will be cold; but the muff I shall keep for myself, for<br>
it is so very pretty. But I do not wish you to be cold. Here is a pair<br>
of lined gloves of my mother's; they just reach up to your elbow. On<br>
with them! Now you look about the hands just like my ugly old mother!"<br>
<br>
And Gerda wept for joy.<br>
<br>
"I can't bear to see you fretting," said the little robber maiden.
"This<br>
is just the time when you ought to look pleased. Here are two loaves and<br>
a ham for you, so that you won't starve." The bread and the meat were<br>
fastened to the Reindeer's back; the little maiden opened the door,<br>
called in all the dogs, and then with her knife cut the rope that<br>
fastened the animal, and said to him, "Now, off with you; but take good<br>
care of the little girl!"<br>
<br>
And Gerda stretched out her hands with the large wadded gloves towards<br>
the robber maiden, and said, "Farewell!" and the Reindeer flew on
over<br>
bush and bramble through the great wood, over moor and heath, as fast as<br>
he could go.<br>
<br>
"Ddsa! Ddsa!" was heard in the sky. It was just as if somebody was<br>
sneezing.<br>
<br>
"These are my old northern-lights," said the Reindeer, "look how
they<br>
gleam!" And on he now sped still quicker--day and night on he went: the<br>
loaves were consumed, and the ham too; and now they were in Lapland.<br>

        <p>1. The robbers attacked Gerda's carriage because it shone like a torch, and the dazzled robbers thought it was made of gold.</p>
        <p>2. The old female robber had a long, scrubby beard, bushy eyebrows that hung down over her eyes, and she commented on Gerda's appearance, calling her plump and beautiful.</p>
        <p>3. The Wood-pigeons told Gerda that they had seen little Kay being carried by a white hen in the carriage of the Snow Queen, who passed over the wood. They mentioned that the Snow Queen's summer tent was in Lapland, and her fixed abode was high up toward the North Pole on the island called Spitzbergen.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>SIXTH STORY. The Lapland Woman and the Finland Woman</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
Suddenly they stopped before a little house, which looked very<br>
miserable. The roof reached to the ground; and the door was so low, that<br>
the family were obliged to creep upon their stomachs when they went in<br>
or out. Nobody was at home except an old Lapland woman, who was dressing<br>
fish by the light of an oil lamp. And the Reindeer told her the whole<br>
of Gerda's history, but first of all his own; for that seemed to him of<br>
much greater importance. Gerda was so chilled that she could not speak.<br>
<br>
"Poor thing," said the Lapland woman, "you have far to run
still. You<br>
have more than a hundred miles to go before you get to Finland; there<br>
the Snow Queen has her country-house, and burns blue lights every<br>
evening. I will give you a few words from me, which I will write on a<br>
dried haberdine, for paper I have none; this you can take with you to<br>
the Finland woman, and she will be able to give you more information<br>
than I can."<br>
<br>
When Gerda had warmed herself, and had eaten and drunk, the Lapland<br>
woman wrote a few words on a dried haberdine, begged Gerda to take care<br>
of them, put her on the Reindeer, bound her fast, and away sprang the<br>
animal. "Ddsa! Ddsa!" was again heard in the air; the most charming<br>
blue lights burned the whole night in the sky, and at last they came to<br>
Finland. They knocked at the chimney of the Finland woman; for as to a<br>
door, she had none.<br>
<br>
There was such a heat inside that the Finland woman herself went about<br>
almost naked. She was diminutive and dirty. She immediately loosened<br>
little Gerda's clothes, pulled off her thick gloves and boots; for<br>
otherwise the heat would have been too great--and after laying a piece<br>
of ice on the Reindeer's head, read what was written on the fish-skin.<br>
She read it three times: she then knew it by heart; so she put the fish<br>
into the cupboard--for it might very well be eaten, and she never threw<br>
anything away.<br>
<br>
Then the Reindeer related his own story first, and afterwards that of<br>
little Gerda; and the Finland woman winked her eyes, but said nothing.<br>
<br>
"You are so clever," said the Reindeer; "you can, I know, twist
all the<br>
winds of the world together in a knot. If the seaman loosens one knot,<br>
then he has a good wind; if a second, then it blows pretty stiffly; if<br>
he undoes the third and fourth, then it rages so that the forests are<br>
upturned. Will you give the little maiden a potion, that she may possess<br>
the strength of twelve men, and vanquish the Snow Queen?"<br>
<br>
"The strength of twelve men!" said the Finland woman. "Much good
that<br>
would be!" Then she went to a cupboard, and drew out a large skin rolled<br>
up. When she had unrolled it, strange characters were to be seen written<br>
thereon; and the Finland woman read at such a rate that the perspiration<br>
trickled down her forehead.<br>
<br>
But the Reindeer begged so hard for little Gerda, and Gerda looked so<br>
imploringly with tearful eyes at the Finland woman, that she winked, and<br>
drew the Reindeer aside into a corner, where they whispered together,<br>
while the animal got some fresh ice put on his head.<br>
<br>
"'Tis true little Kay is at the Snow Queen's, and finds everything there<br>
quite to his taste; and he thinks it the very best place in the world;<br>
but the reason of that is, he has a splinter of glass in his eye, and in<br>
his heart. These must be got out first; otherwise he will never go back<br>
to mankind, and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him."<br>
<br>
"But can you give little Gerda nothing to take which will endue her with<br>
power over the whole?"<br>
<br>
"I can give her no more power than what she has already. Don't you see<br>
how great it is? Don't you see how men and animals are forced to serve<br>
her; how well she gets through the world barefooted? She must not hear<br>
of her power from us; that power lies in her heart, because she is<br>
a sweet and innocent child! If she cannot get to the Snow Queen by<br>
herself, and rid little Kay of the glass, we cannot help her. Two miles<br>
hence the garden of the Snow Queen begins; thither you may carry the<br>
little girl. Set her down by the large bush with red berries, standing<br>
in the snow; don't stay talking, but hasten back as fast as possible."<br>
And now the Finland woman placed little Gerda on the Reindeer's back,<br>
and off he ran with all imaginable speed.<br>
<br>
"Oh! I have not got my boots! I have not brought my gloves!" cried<br>
little Gerda. She remarked she was without them from the cutting frost;<br>
but the Reindeer dared not stand still; on he ran till he came to the<br>
great bush with the red berries, and there he set Gerda down, kissed her<br>
mouth, while large bright tears flowed from the animal's eyes, and then<br>
back he went as fast as possible. There stood poor Gerda now, without<br>
shoes or gloves, in the very middle of dreadful icy Finland.<br>
<br>
She ran on as fast as she could. There then came a whole regiment of<br>
snow-flakes, but they did not fall from above, and they were quite<br>
bright and shining from the Aurora Borealis. The flakes ran along<br>
the ground, and the nearer they came the larger they grew. Gerda well<br>
remembered how large and strange the snow-flakes appeared when she<br>
once saw them through a magnifying-glass; but now they were large and<br>
terrific in another manner--they were all alive. They were the outposts<br>
of the Snow Queen. They had the most wondrous shapes; some looked like<br>
large ugly porcupines; others like snakes knotted together, with their<br>
heads sticking out; and others, again, like small fat bears, with the<br>
hair standing on end: all were of dazzling whiteness--all were living<br>
snow-flakes.<br>
<br>
Little Gerda repeated the Lord's Prayer. The cold was so intense that<br>
she could see her own breath, which came like smoke out of her mouth. It<br>
grew thicker and thicker, and took the form of little angels, that grew<br>
more and more when they touched the earth. All had helms on their heads,<br>
and lances and shields in their hands; they increased in numbers; and<br>
when Gerda had finished the Lord's Prayer, she was surrounded by a whole<br>
legion. They thrust at the horrid snow-flakes with their spears, so that<br>
they flew into a thousand pieces; and little Gerda walked on bravely and<br>
in security. The angels patted her hands and feet; and then she felt the<br>
cold less, and went on quickly towards the palace of the Snow Queen.<br>
<br>
But now we shall see how Kay fared. He never thought of Gerda, and least<br>
of all that she was standing before the palace.<br>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>SEVENTH STORY. What Took Place in the Palace of the Snow Queen, and what Happened Afterward.</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
The walls of the palace were of driving snow, and the windows and doors<br>
of cutting winds. There were more than a hundred halls there, according<br>
as the snow was driven by the winds. The largest was many miles in<br>
extent; all were lighted up by the powerful Aurora Borealis, and all<br>
were so large, so empty, so icy cold, and so resplendent! Mirth never<br>
reigned there; there was never even a little bear-ball, with the storm<br>
for music, while the polar bears went on their hind legs and showed off<br>
their steps. Never a little tea-party of white young lady foxes; vast,<br>
cold, and empty were the halls of the Snow Queen. The northern-lights<br>
shone with such precision that one could tell exactly when they were<br>
at their highest or lowest degree of brightness. In the middle of the<br>
empty, endless hall of snow, was a frozen lake; it was cracked in a<br>
thousand pieces, but each piece was so like the other, that it seemed<br>
the work of a cunning artificer. In the middle of this lake sat the Snow<br>
Queen when she was at home; and then she said she was sitting in the<br>
Mirror of Understanding, and that this was the only one and the best<br>
thing in the world.<br>
<br>
Little Kay was quite blue, yes nearly black with cold; but he did not<br>
observe it, for she had kissed away all feeling of cold from his body,<br>
and his heart was a lump of ice. He was dragging along some pointed<br>
flat pieces of ice, which he laid together in all possible ways, for he<br>
wanted to make something with them; just as we have little flat pieces<br>
of wood to make geometrical figures with, called the Chinese Puzzle.<br>
Kay made all sorts of figures, the most complicated, for it was<br>
an ice-puzzle for the understanding. In his eyes the figures were<br>
extraordinarily beautiful, and of the utmost importance; for the bit<br>
of glass which was in his eye caused this. He found whole figures which<br>
represented a written word; but he never could manage to represent just<br>
the word he wanted--that word was "eternity"; and the Snow Queen had<br>
said, "If you can discover that figure, you shall be your own master,<br>
and I will make you a present of the whole world and a pair of new<br>
skates." But he could not find it out.<br>
<br>
"I am going now to warm lands," said the Snow Queen. "I must
have a look<br>
down into the black caldrons." It was the volcanoes Vesuvius and Etna<br>
that she meant. "I will just give them a coating of white, for that is<br>
as it ought to be; besides, it is good for the oranges and the grapes."<br>
And then away she flew, and Kay sat quite alone in the empty halls of<br>
ice that were miles long, and looked at the blocks of ice, and thought<br>
and thought till his skull was almost cracked. There he sat quite<br>
benumbed and motionless; one would have imagined he was frozen to death.<br>
<br>
Suddenly little Gerda stepped through the great portal into the palace.<br>
The gate was formed of cutting winds; but Gerda repeated her evening<br>
prayer, and the winds were laid as though they slept; and the little<br>
maiden entered the vast, empty, cold halls. There she beheld Kay: she<br>
recognised him, flew to embrace him, and cried out, her arms firmly<br>
holding him the while, "Kay, sweet little Kay! Have I then found you at<br>
last?"<br>
<br>
But he sat quite still, benumbed and cold. Then little Gerda shed<br>
burning tears; and they fell on his bosom, they penetrated to his<br>
heart, they thawed the lumps of ice, and consumed the splinters of the<br>
looking-glass; he looked at her, and she sang the hymn:<br>
<br>
"The rose in the valley is blooming so sweet, And angels descend there<br>
the children to greet."<br>
<br>
Hereupon Kay burst into tears; he wept so much that the splinter rolled<br>
out of his eye, and he recognised her, and shouted, "Gerda, sweet little<br>
Gerda! Where have you been so long? And where have I been?" He looked<br>
round him. "How cold it is here!" said he. "How empty and
cold!" And he<br>
held fast by Gerda, who laughed and wept for joy. It was so beautiful,<br>
that even the blocks of ice danced about for joy; and when they were<br>
tired and laid themselves down, they formed exactly the letters which<br>
the Snow Queen had told him to find out; so now he was his own master,<br>
and he would have the whole world and a pair of new skates into the<br>
bargain.<br>
<br>
Gerda kissed his cheeks, and they grew quite blooming; she kissed his<br>
eyes, and they shone like her own; she kissed his hands and feet, and he<br>
was again well and merry. The Snow Queen might come back as soon as she<br>
liked; there stood his discharge written in resplendent masses of ice.<br>
<br>
They took each other by the hand, and wandered forth out of the large<br>
hall; they talked of their old grandmother, and of the roses upon the<br>
roof; and wherever they went, the winds ceased raging, and the sun burst<br>
forth. And when they reached the bush with the red berries, they found<br>
the Reindeer waiting for them. He had brought another, a young one, with<br>
him, whose udder was filled with milk, which he gave to the little ones,<br>
and kissed their lips. They then carried Kay and Gerda--first to the<br>
Finland woman, where they warmed themselves in the warm room, and<br>
learned what they were to do on their journey home; and they went to<br>
the Lapland woman, who made some new clothes for them and repaired their<br>
sledges.<br>
<br>
The Reindeer and the young hind leaped along beside them, and<br>
accompanied them to the boundary of the country. Here the first<br>
vegetation peeped forth; here Kay and Gerda took leave of the Lapland<br>
woman. "Farewell! Farewell!" they all said. And the first green buds<br>
appeared, the first little birds began to chirrup; and out of the wood<br>
came, riding on a magnificent horse, which Gerda knew (it was one of the<br>
leaders in the golden carriage), a young damsel with a bright-red cap on<br>
her head, and armed with pistols. It was the little robber maiden, who,<br>
tired of being at home, had determined to make a journey to the north;<br>
and afterwards in another direction, if that did not please her. She<br>
recognised Gerda immediately, and Gerda knew her too. It was a joyful<br>
meeting.<br>
<br>
"You are a fine fellow for tramping about," said she to little Kay;
"I<br>
should like to know, faith, if you deserve that one should run from one<br>
end of the world to the other for your sake?"<br>
<br>
But Gerda patted her cheeks, and inquired for the Prince and Princess.<br>
<br>
"They are gone abroad," said the other.<br>
<br>
"But the Raven?" asked little Gerda.<br>
<br>
"Oh! The Raven is dead," she answered. "His tame sweetheart is a<br>
widow, and wears a bit of black worsted round her leg; she laments most<br>
piteously, but it's all mere talk and stuff! Now tell me what you've<br>
been doing and how you managed to catch him."<br>
<br>
And Gerda and Kay both told their story.<br>
<br>
And "Schnipp-schnapp-schnurre-basselurre," said the robber maiden;
and<br>
she took the hands of each, and promised that if she should some day<br>
pass through the town where they lived, she would come and visit them;<br>
and then away she rode. Kay and Gerda took each other's hand: it was<br>
lovely spring weather, with abundance of flowers and of verdure. The<br>
church-bells rang, and the children recognised the high towers, and the<br>
large town; it was that in which they dwelt. They entered and hastened<br>
up to their grandmother's room, where everything was standing as<br>
formerly. The clock said "tick! tack!" and the finger moved round;
but<br>
as they entered, they remarked that they were now grown up. The roses<br>
on the leads hung blooming in at the open window; there stood the little<br>
children's chairs, and Kay and Gerda sat down on them, holding each<br>
other by the hand; they both had forgotten the cold empty splendor of<br>
the Snow Queen, as though it had been a dream. The grandmother sat in<br>
the bright sunshine, and read aloud from the Bible: "Unless ye become as<br>
little children, ye cannot enter the kingdom of heaven."<br>
<br>
And Kay and Gerda looked in each other's eyes, and all at once they<br>
understood the old hymn:<br>
<br>
"The rose in the valley is blooming so sweet, And angels descend there<br>
the children to greet."<br>
<br>
There sat the two grown-up persons; grown-up, and yet children; children<br>
at least in heart; and it was summer-time; summer, glorious summer!<br>
