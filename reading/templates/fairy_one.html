    <p class="w3-large"><strong>THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
Many years ago, there was an Emperor, who was so excessively fond of<br>
new clothes, that he spent all his money in dress. He did not trouble<br>
himself in the least about his soldiers; nor did he care to go either to<br>
the theatre or the chase, except for the opportunities then afforded him<br>
for displaying his new clothes. He had a different suit for each hour of<br>
the day; and as of any other king or emperor, one is accustomed to say,<br>
"he is sitting in council," it was always said of him, "The
Emperor is<br>
sitting in his wardrobe."<br>
<br>
Time passed merrily in the large town which was his capital; strangers<br>
arrived every day at the court. One day, two rogues, calling themselves<br>
weavers, made their appearance. They gave out that they knew how to<br>
weave stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns, the<br>
clothes manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of<br>
remaining invisible to everyone who was unfit for the office he held, or<br>
who was extraordinarily simple in character.<br>
<br>
"These must, indeed, be splendid clothes!" thought the Emperor.
"Had I<br>
such a suit, I might at once find out what men in my realms are unfit<br>
for their office, and also be able to distinguish the wise from the<br>
foolish! This stuff must be woven for me immediately." And he caused<br>
large sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they<br>
might begin their work directly.<br>
<br>
So the two pretended weavers set up two looms, and affected to work very<br>
busily, though in reality they did nothing at all. They asked for the<br>
most delicate silk and the purest gold thread; put both into their own<br>
knapsacks; and then continued their pretended work at the empty looms<br>
until late at night.<br>
<br>
"I should like to know how the weavers are getting on with my cloth,"<br>
said the Emperor to himself, after some little time had elapsed; he was,<br>
however, rather embarrassed, when he remembered that a simpleton, or<br>
one unfit for his office, would be unable to see the manufacture. To be<br>
sure, he thought he had nothing to risk in his own person; but yet, he<br>
would prefer sending somebody else, to bring him intelligence about the<br>
weavers, and their work, before he troubled himself in the affair. All<br>
the people throughout the city had heard of the wonderful property the<br>
cloth was to possess; and all were anxious to learn how wise, or how<br>
ignorant, their neighbors might prove to be.<br>
<br>
"I will send my faithful old minister to the weavers," said the
Emperor<br>
at last, after some deliberation, "he will be best able to see how the<br>
cloth looks; for he is a man of sense, and no one can be more suitable<br>
for his office than he is."<br>
<br>
So the faithful old minister went into the hall, where the knaves were<br>
working with all their might, at their empty looms. "What can be the<br>
meaning of this?" thought the old man, opening his eyes very wide. "I<br>
cannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms." However, he did<br>
not express his thoughts aloud.<br>
<br>
The impostors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come<br>
nearer their looms; and then asked him whether the design pleased<br>
him, and whether the colors were not very beautiful; at the same time<br>
pointing to the empty frames. The poor old minister looked and looked,<br>
he could not discover anything on the looms, for a very good reason,<br>
viz: there was nothing there. "What!" thought he again. "Is it
possible<br>
that I am a simpleton? I have never thought so myself; and no one must<br>
know it now if I am so. Can it be, that I am unfit for my office? No,<br>
that must not be said either. I will never confess that I could not see<br>
the stuff."<br>
<br>
"Well, Sir Minister!" said one of the knaves, still pretending to
work.<br>
"You do not say whether the stuff pleases you."<br>
<br>
"Oh, it is excellent!" replied the old minister, looking at the loom<br>
through his spectacles. "This pattern, and the colors, yes, I will tell<br>
the Emperor without delay, how very beautiful I think them."<br>
<br>
"We shall be much obliged to you," said the impostors, and then they<br>
named the different colors and described the pattern of the pretended<br>
stuff. The old minister listened attentively to their words, in order<br>
that he might repeat them to the Emperor; and then the knaves asked for<br>
more silk and gold, saying that it was necessary to complete what<br>
they had begun. However, they put all that was given them into their<br>
knapsacks; and continued to work with as much apparent diligence as<br>
before at their empty looms.<br>
<br>
The Emperor now sent another officer of his court to see how the men<br>
were getting on, and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be<br>
ready. It was just the same with this gentleman as with the minister;<br>
he surveyed the looms on all sides, but could see nothing at all but the<br>
empty frames.<br>
<br>
"Does not the stuff appear as beautiful to you, as it did to my lord the<br>
minister?" asked the impostors of the Emperor's second ambassador; at<br>
the same time making the same gestures as before, and talking of the<br>
design and colors which were not there.<br>
<br>
"I certainly am not stupid!" thought the messenger. "It must be,
that I<br>
am not fit for my good, profitable office! That is very odd; however, no<br>
one shall know anything about it." And accordingly he praised the stuff<br>
he could not see, and declared that he was delighted with both colors<br>
and patterns. "Indeed, please your Imperial Majesty," said he to his<br>
sovereign when he returned, "the cloth which the weavers are preparing<br>
is extraordinarily magnificent."<br>
<br>
The whole city was talking of the splendid cloth which the Emperor had<br>
ordered to be woven at his own expense.<br>
<br>
And now the Emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture, while<br>
it was still in the loom. Accompanied by a select number of officers of<br>
the court, among whom were the two honest men who had already admired<br>
the cloth, he went to the crafty impostors, who, as soon as they were<br>
aware of the Emperor's approach, went on working more diligently than<br>
ever; although they still did not pass a single thread through the<br>
looms.<br>
<br>
"Is not the work absolutely magnificent?" said the two officers of
the<br>
crown, already mentioned. "If your Majesty will only be pleased to look<br>
at it! What a splendid design! What glorious colors!" and at the same<br>
time they pointed to the empty frames; for they imagined that everyone<br>
else could see this exquisite piece of workmanship.<br>
<br>
"How is this?" said the Emperor to himself. "I can see nothing!
This<br>
is indeed a terrible affair! Am I a simpleton, or am I unfit to be an<br>
Emperor? That would be the worst thing that could happen--Oh! the cloth<br>
is charming," said he, aloud. "It has my complete approbation."
And he<br>
smiled most graciously, and looked closely at the empty looms; for on no<br>
account would he say that he could not see what two of the officers of<br>
his court had praised so much. All his retinue now strained their eyes,<br>
hoping to discover something on the looms, but they could see no more<br>
than the others; nevertheless, they all exclaimed, "Oh, how
beautiful!"<br>
and advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid<br>
material, for the approaching procession. "Magnificent! Charming!<br>
Excellent!" resounded on all sides; and everyone was uncommonly gay. The<br>
Emperor shared in the general satisfaction; and presented the impostors<br>
with the riband of an order of knighthood, to be worn in their<br>
button-holes, and the title of "Gentlemen Weavers."<br>
<br>
The rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the<br>
procession was to take place, and had sixteen lights burning, so that<br>
everyone might see how anxious they were to finish the Emperor's new<br>
suit. They pretended to roll the cloth off the looms; cut the air with<br>
their scissors; and sewed with needles without any thread in them.<br>
"See!" cried they, at last. "The Emperor's new clothes are
ready!"<br>
<br>
And now the Emperor, with all the grandees of his court, came to the<br>
weavers; and the rogues raised their arms, as if in the act of holding<br>
something up, saying, "Here are your Majesty's trousers! Here is the<br>
scarf! Here is the mantle! The whole suit is as light as a cobweb;<br>
one might fancy one has nothing at all on, when dressed in it; that,<br>
however, is the great virtue of this delicate cloth."<br>
<br>
"Yes indeed!" said all the courtiers, although not one of them could
see<br>
anything of this exquisite manufacture.<br>
<br>
"If your Imperial Majesty will be graciously pleased to take off your<br>
clothes, we will fit on the new suit, in front of the looking glass."<br>
<br>
The Emperor was accordingly undressed, and the rogues pretended to<br>
array him in his new suit; the Emperor turning round, from side to side,<br>
before the looking glass.<br>
<br>
"How splendid his Majesty looks in his new clothes, and how well they<br>
fit!" everyone cried out. "What a design! What colors! These are
indeed<br>
royal robes!"<br>
<br>
"The canopy which is to be borne over your Majesty, in the procession,<br>
is waiting," announced the chief master of the ceremonies.<br>
<br>
"I am quite ready," answered the Emperor. "Do my new clothes fit
well?"<br>
asked he, turning himself round again before the looking glass, in order<br>
that he might appear to be examining his handsome suit.<br>
<br>
The lords of the bedchamber, who were to carry his Majesty's train felt<br>
about on the ground, as if they were lifting up the ends of the mantle;<br>
and pretended to be carrying something; for they would by no means<br>
betray anything like simplicity, or unfitness for their office.<br>
<br>
So now the Emperor walked under his high canopy in the midst of the<br>
procession, through the streets of his capital; and all the people<br>
standing by, and those at the windows, cried out, "Oh! How beautiful<br>
are our Emperor's new clothes! What a magnificent train there is to<br>
the mantle; and how gracefully the scarf hangs!" in short, no one would<br>
allow that he could not see these much-admired clothes; because, in<br>
doing so, he would have declared himself either a simpleton or unfit<br>
for his office. Certainly, none of the Emperor's various suits, had ever<br>
made so great an impression, as these invisible ones.<br>
<br>
"But the Emperor has nothing at all on!" said a little child.<br>
<br>
"Listen to the voice of innocence!" exclaimed his father; and what
the<br>
child had said was whispered from one to another.<br>
<br>
"But he has nothing at all on!" at last cried out all the people.<br>
The Emperor was vexed, for he knew that the people were right; but he<br>
thought the procession must go on now! And the lords of the bedchamber<br>
took greater pains than ever, to appear holding up a train, although, in<br>
reality, there was no train to hold.<br>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>THE SWINEHERD</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
There was once a poor Prince, who had a kingdom. His kingdom was very<br>
small, but still quite large enough to marry upon; and he wished to<br>
marry.<br>
<br>
It was certainly rather cool of him to say to the Emperor's daughter,<br>
"Will you have me?" But so he did; for his name was renowned far and<br>
wide; and there were a hundred princesses who would have answered,<br>
"Yes!" and "Thank you kindly." We shall see what this
princess said.<br>
<br>
Listen!<br>
<br>
It happened that where the Prince's father lay buried, there grew a rose<br>
tree--a most beautiful rose tree, which blossomed only once in every<br>
five years, and even then bore only one flower, but that was a rose!<br>
It smelt so sweet that all cares and sorrows were forgotten by him who<br>
inhaled its fragrance.<br>
<br>
And furthermore, the Prince had a nightingale, who could sing in such a<br>
manner that it seemed as though all sweet melodies dwelt in her little<br>
throat. So the Princess was to have the rose, and the nightingale; and<br>
they were accordingly put into large silver caskets, and sent to her.<br>
<br>
The Emperor had them brought into a large hall, where the Princess was<br>
playing at "Visiting," with the ladies of the court; and when she saw<br>
the caskets with the presents, she clapped her hands for joy.<br>
<br>
"Ah, if it were but a little pussy-cat!" said she; but the rose tree,<br>
with its beautiful rose came to view.<br>
<br>
"Oh, how prettily it is made!" said all the court ladies.<br>
<br>
"It is more than pretty," said the Emperor, "it is
charming!"<br>
<br>
But the Princess touched it, and was almost ready to cry.<br>
<br>
"Fie, papa!" said she. "It is not made at all, it is
natural!"<br>
<br>
"Let us see what is in the other casket, before we get into a bad<br>
humor," said the Emperor. So the nightingale came forth and sang so<br>
delightfully that at first no one could say anything ill-humored of her.<br>
<br>
"Superbe! Charmant!" exclaimed the ladies; for they all used to
chatter<br>
French, each one worse than her neighbor.<br>
<br>
"How much the bird reminds me of the musical box that belonged to our<br>
blessed Empress," said an old knight. "Oh yes! These are the same
tones,<br>
the same execution."<br>
<br>
"Yes! yes!" said the Emperor, and he wept like a child at the<br>
remembrance.<br>
<br>
"I will still hope that it is not a real bird," said the Princess.<br>
<br>
"Yes, it is a real bird," said those who had brought it. "Well
then let<br>
the bird fly," said the Princess; and she positively refused to see the<br>
Prince.<br>
<br>
However, he was not to be discouraged; he daubed his face over brown and<br>
black; pulled his cap over his ears, and knocked at the door.<br>
<br>
"Good day to my lord, the Emperor!" said he. "Can I have
employment at<br>
the palace?"<br>
<br>
"Why, yes," said the Emperor. "I want some one to take care of
the pigs,<br>
for we have a great many of them."<br>
<br>
So the Prince was appointed "Imperial Swineherd." He had a dirty
little<br>
room close by the pigsty; and there he sat the whole day, and worked. By<br>
the evening he had made a pretty little kitchen-pot. Little bells were<br>
hung all round it; and when the pot was boiling, these bells tinkled in<br>
the most charming manner, and played the old melody,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ach! du lieber Augustin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alles ist weg, weg, weg!"*<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * "Ah! dear Augustine!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All is gone, gone, gone!"<br>
<br>
<br>
But what was still more curious, whoever held his finger in the smoke of<br>
the kitchen-pot, immediately smelt all the dishes that were cooking on<br>
every hearth in the city--this, you see, was something quite different<br>
from the rose.<br>
<br>
Now the Princess happened to walk that way; and when she heard the tune,<br>
she stood quite still, and seemed pleased; for she could play "Lieber<br>
Augustine"; it was the only piece she knew; and she played it with one<br>
finger.<br>
<br>
"Why there is my piece," said the Princess. "That swineherd must<br>
certainly have been well educated! Go in and ask him the price of the<br>
instrument."<br>
<br>
So one of the court-ladies must run in; however, she drew on wooden<br>
slippers first.<br>
<br>
"What will you take for the kitchen-pot?" said the lady.<br>
<br>
"I will have ten kisses from the Princess," said the swineherd.<br>
<br>
"Yes, indeed!" said the lady.<br>
<br>
"I cannot sell it for less," rejoined the swineherd.<br>
<br>
"He is an impudent fellow!" said the Princess, and she walked on; but<br>
when she had gone a little way, the bells tinkled so prettily<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ach! du lieber Augustin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alles ist weg, weg, weg!"<br>
<br>
"Stay," said the Princess. "Ask him if he will have ten kisses
from the<br>
ladies of my court."<br>
<br>
"No, thank you!" said the swineherd. "Ten kisses from the
Princess, or I<br>
keep the kitchen-pot myself."<br>
<br>
"That must not be, either!" said the Princess. "But do you all
stand<br>
before me that no one may see us."<br>
<br>
And the court-ladies placed themselves in front of her, and spread<br>
out their dresses--the swineherd got ten kisses, and the Princess--the<br>
kitchen-pot.<br>
<br>
That was delightful! The pot was boiling the whole evening, and the<br>
whole of the following day. They knew perfectly well what was cooking at<br>
every fire throughout the city, from the chamberlain's to the cobbler's;<br>
the court-ladies danced and clapped their hands.<br>
<br>
"We know who has soup, and who has pancakes for dinner to-day, who has<br>
cutlets, and who has eggs. How interesting!"<br>
<br>
"Yes, but keep my secret, for I am an Emperor's daughter."<br>
<br>
The swineherd--that is to say--the Prince, for no one knew that he was<br>
other than an ill-favored swineherd, let not a day pass without working<br>
at something; he at last constructed a rattle, which, when it was swung<br>
round, played all the waltzes and jig tunes, which have ever been heard<br>
since the creation of the world.<br>
<br>
"Ah, that is superbe!" said the Princess when she passed by. "I
have<br>
never heard prettier compositions! Go in and ask him the price of the<br>
instrument; but mind, he shall have no more kisses!"<br>
<br>
"He will have a hundred kisses from the Princess!" said the lady who
had<br>
been to ask.<br>
<br>
"I think he is not in his right senses!" said the Princess, and
walked<br>
on, but when she had gone a little way, she stopped again. "One must<br>
encourage art," said she, "I am the Emperor's daughter. Tell him he<br>
shall, as on yesterday, have ten kisses from me, and may take the rest<br>
from the ladies of the court."<br>
<br>
"Oh--but we should not like that at all!" said they. "What are
you<br>
muttering?" asked the Princess. "If I can kiss him, surely you can.<br>
Remember that you owe everything to me." So the ladies were obliged to<br>
go to him again.<br>
<br>
"A hundred kisses from the Princess," said he, "or else let
everyone<br>
keep his own!"<br>
<br>
"Stand round!" said she; and all the ladies stood round her whilst
the<br>
kissing was going on.<br>
<br>
"What can be the reason for such a crowd close by the pigsty?" said
the<br>
Emperor, who happened just then to step out on the balcony; he rubbed<br>
his eyes, and put on his spectacles. "They are the ladies of the<br>
court; I must go down and see what they are about!" So he pulled up his<br>
slippers at the heel, for he had trodden them down.<br>
<br>
As soon as he had got into the court-yard, he moved very softly, and the<br>
ladies were so much engrossed with counting the kisses, that all might<br>
go on fairly, that they did not perceive the Emperor. He rose on his<br>
tiptoes.<br>
<br>
"What is all this?" said he, when he saw what was going on, and he
boxed<br>
the Princess's ears with his slipper, just as the swineherd was taking<br>
the eighty-sixth kiss.<br>
<br>
"March out!" said the Emperor, for he was very angry; and both
Princess<br>
and swineherd were thrust out of the city.<br>
<br>
The Princess now stood and wept, the swineherd scolded, and the rain<br>
poured down.<br>
<br>
"Alas! Unhappy creature that I am!" said the Princess. "If I had
but<br>
married the handsome young Prince! Ah! how unfortunate I am!"<br>
<br>
And the swineherd went behind a tree, washed the black and brown color<br>
from his face, threw off his dirty clothes, and stepped forth in his<br>
princely robes; he looked so noble that the Princess could not help<br>
bowing before him.<br>
<br>
"I am come to despise thee," said he. "Thou would'st not have an<br>
honorable Prince! Thou could'st not prize the rose and the nightingale,<br>
but thou wast ready to kiss the swineherd for the sake of a trumpery<br>
plaything. Thou art rightly served."<br>
<br>
He then went back to his own little kingdom, and shut the door of his<br>
palace in her face. Now she might well sing,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ach! du lieber Augustin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alles ist weg, weg, weg!"<br>

    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
There was once a Prince who wished to marry a Princess; but then she<br>
must be a real Princess. He travelled all over the world in hopes of<br>
finding such a lady; but there was always something wrong. Princesses he<br>
found in plenty; but whether they were real Princesses it was impossible<br>
for him to decide, for now one thing, now another, seemed to him not<br>
quite right about the ladies. At last he returned to his palace quite<br>
cast down, because he wished so much to have a real Princess for his<br>
wife.<br>
<br>
One evening a fearful tempest arose, it thundered and lightened, and the<br>
rain poured down from the sky in torrents: besides, it was as dark as<br>
pitch. All at once there was heard a violent knocking at the door, and<br>
the old King, the Prince's father, went out himself to open it.<br>
<br>
It was a Princess who was standing outside the door. What with the rain<br>
and the wind, she was in a sad condition; the water trickled down from<br>
her hair, and her clothes clung to her body. She said she was a real<br>
Princess.<br>
<br>
"Ah! we shall soon see that!" thought the old Queen-mother; however,
she<br>
said not a word of what she was going to do; but went quietly into the<br>
bedroom, took all the bed-clothes off the bed, and put three little peas<br>
on the bedstead. She then laid twenty mattresses one upon another over<br>
the three peas, and put twenty feather beds over the mattresses.<br>
<br>
Upon this bed the Princess was to pass the night.<br>
<br>
The next morning she was asked how she had slept. "Oh, very badly<br>
indeed!" she replied. "I have scarcely closed my eyes the whole night<br>
through. I do not know what was in my bed, but I had something hard<br>
under me, and am all over black and blue. It has hurt me so much!"<br>
<br>
Now it was plain that the lady must be a real Princess, since she had<br>
been able to feel the three little peas through the twenty mattresses<br>
and twenty feather beds. None but a real Princess could have had such a<br>
delicate sense of feeling.<br>
<br>
The Prince accordingly made her his wife; being now convinced that he<br>
had found a real Princess. The three peas were however put into the<br>
cabinet of curiosities, where they are still to be seen, provided they<br>
are not lost.<br>
<br>
Wasn't this a lady of real delicacy?<br>

        <p>1. The Prince traveled all over the world in hopes of finding a real Princess to marry.</p>
        <p>2. The old Queen-mother placed three peas on the bedstead, covered them with twenty mattresses and twenty feather beds, and asked the Princess how she had slept. A real Princess, with a delicate sense of feeling, would be able to feel the three peas through all the bedding. </p>
        <p>3. The fact that the Princess could feel the presence of the three peas through the twenty mattresses and twenty feather beds convinced the Prince that she was a real Princess. This showed her delicate sense of feeling, which was a characteristic he had been looking for.</p>
