<br>
It is in the hot lands that the sun burns, sure enough! there the people<br>
become quite a mahogany brown, ay, and in the HOTTEST lands they are<br>
burnt to Negroes. But now it was only to the HOT lands that a learned<br>
man had come from the cold; there he thought that he could run about<br>
just as when at home, but he soon found out his mistake.<br>
<br>
He, and all sensible folks, were obliged to stay within doors--the<br>
window-shutters and doors were closed the whole day; it looked as if the<br>
whole house slept, or there was no one at home.<br>
<br>
The narrow street with the high houses, was built so that the sunshine<br>
must fall there from morning till evening--it was really not to be<br>
borne.<br>
<br>
The learned man from the cold lands--he was a young man, and seemed to<br>
be a clever man--sat in a glowing oven; it took effect on him, he became<br>
quite meagre--even his shadow shrunk in, for the sun had also an effect<br>
on it. It was first towards evening when the sun was down, that they<br>
began to freshen up again.<br>
<br>
In the warm lands every window has a balcony, and the people came out on<br>
all the balconies in the street--for one must have air, even if one be<br>
accustomed to be mahogany!* It was lively both up and down the<br>
street. Tailors, and shoemakers, and all the folks, moved out into the<br>
street--chairs and tables were brought forth--and candles burnt--yes,<br>
above a thousand lights were burning--and the one talked and the other<br>
sung; and people walked and church-bells rang, and asses went along with<br>
a dingle-dingle-dong! for they too had bells on. The street boys were<br>
screaming and hooting, and shouting and shooting, with devils and<br>
detonating balls--and there came corpse bearers and hood wearers--for<br>
there were funerals with psalm and hymn--and then the din of carriages<br>
driving and company arriving: yes, it was, in truth, lively enough down<br>
in the street. Only in that single house, which stood opposite that in<br>
which the learned foreigner lived, it was quite still; and yet some one<br>
lived there, for there stood flowers in the balcony--they grew so<br>
well in the sun's heat! and that they could not do unless they were<br>
watered--and some one must water them--there must be somebody there.<br>
The door opposite was also opened late in the evening, but it was dark<br>
within, at least in the front room; further in there was heard the sound<br>
of music. The learned foreigner thought it quite marvellous, but now--it<br>
might be that he only imagined it--for he found everything marvellous<br>
out there, in the warm lands, if there had only been no sun. The<br>
stranger's landlord said that he didn't know who had taken the house<br>
opposite, one saw no person about, and as to the music, it appeared<br>
to him to be extremely tiresome. "It is as if some one sat there, and<br>
practised a piece that he could not master--always the same piece. 'I<br>
shall master it!' says he; but yet he cannot master it, however long he<br>
plays."<br>
<br>
* The word mahogany can be understood, in Danish, as having two<br>
meanings. In general, it means the reddish-brown wood itself; but in<br>
jest, it signifies "excessively fine," which arose from an anecdote
of<br>
Nyboder, in Copenhagen, (the seamen's quarter.) A sailor's wife, who was<br>
always proud and fine, in her way, came to her neighbor, and complained<br>
that she had got a splinter in her finger. "What of?" asked the<br>
neighbor's wife. "It is a mahogany splinter," said the other.
"Mahogany!<br>
It cannot be less with you!" exclaimed the woman--and thence the<br>
proverb, "It is so mahogany!"--(that is, so excessively fine)--is<br>
derived.<br>
<br>
<br>
One night the stranger awoke--he slept with the doors of the balcony<br>
open--the curtain before it was raised by the wind, and he thought<br>
that a strange lustre came from the opposite neighbor's house; all the<br>
flowers shone like flames, in the most beautiful colors, and in the<br>
midst of the flowers stood a slender, graceful maiden--it was as if she<br>
also shone; the light really hurt his eyes. He now opened them quite<br>
wide--yes, he was quite awake; with one spring he was on the floor; he<br>
crept gently behind the curtain, but the maiden was gone; the flowers<br>
shone no longer, but there they stood, fresh and blooming as ever;<br>
the door was ajar, and, far within, the music sounded so soft and<br>
delightful, one could really melt away in sweet thoughts from it. Yet<br>
it was like a piece of enchantment. And who lived there? Where was the<br>
actual entrance? The whole of the ground-floor was a row of shops, and<br>
there people could not always be running through.<br>
<br>
One evening the stranger sat out on the balcony. The light burnt in the<br>
room behind him; and thus it was quite natural that his shadow should<br>
fall on his opposite neighbor's wall. Yes! there it sat, directly<br>
opposite, between the flowers on the balcony; and when the stranger<br>
moved, the shadow also moved: for that it always does.<br>
<br>
"I think my shadow is the only living thing one sees over there,"
said<br>
the learned man. "See, how nicely it sits between the flowers. The door<br>
stands half-open: now the shadow should be cunning, and go into the<br>
room, look about, and then come and tell me what it had seen. Come, now!<br>
Be useful, and do me a service," said he, in jest. "Have the kindness
to<br>
step in. Now! Art thou going?" and then he nodded to the shadow, and the<br>
shadow nodded again. "Well then, go! But don't stay away."<br>
<br>
The stranger rose, and his shadow on the opposite neighbor's balcony<br>
rose also; the stranger turned round and the shadow also turned round.<br>
Yes! if anyone had paid particular attention to it, they would have<br>
seen, quite distinctly, that the shadow went in through the half-open<br>
balcony-door of their opposite neighbor, just as the stranger went into<br>
his own room, and let the long curtain fall down after him.<br>
<br>
Next morning, the learned man went out to drink coffee and read the<br>
newspapers.<br>
<br>
"What is that?" said he, as he came out into the sunshine. "I
have no<br>
shadow! So then, it has actually gone last night, and not come again. It<br>
is really tiresome!"<br>
<br>
This annoyed him: not so much because the shadow was gone, but because<br>
he knew there was a story about a man without a shadow.* It was known<br>
to everybody at home, in the cold lands; and if the learned man now came<br>
there and told his story, they would say that he was imitating it, and<br>
that he had no need to do. He would, therefore, not talk about it at<br>
all; and that was wisely thought.<br>
<br>
*Peter Schlemihl, the shadowless man.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the evening he went out again on the balcony. He had placed the light<br>
directly behind him, for he knew that the shadow would always have its<br>
master for a screen, but he could not entice it. He made himself little;<br>
he made himself great: but no shadow came again. He said, "Hem! hem!"<br>
but it was of no use.<br>
<br>
It was vexatious; but in the warm lands everything grows so quickly; and<br>
after the lapse of eight days he observed, to his great joy, that a new<br>
shadow came in the sunshine. In the course of three weeks he had a very<br>
fair shadow, which, when he set out for his home in the northern lands,<br>
grew more and more in the journey, so that at last it was so long and so<br>
large, that it was more than sufficient.<br>
<br>
The learned man then came home, and he wrote books about what was true<br>
in the world, and about what was good and what was beautiful; and there<br>
passed days and years--yes! many years passed away.<br>
<br>
One evening, as he was sitting in his room, there was a gentle knocking<br>
at the door.<br>
<br>
"Come in!" said he; but no one came in; so he opened the door, and
there<br>
stood before him such an extremely lean man, that he felt quite strange.<br>
As to the rest, the man was very finely dressed--he must be a gentleman.<br>
<br>
"Whom have I the honor of speaking?" asked the learned man.<br>
<br>
"Yes! I thought as much," said the fine man. "I thought you
would not<br>
know me. I have got so much body. I have even got flesh and clothes. You<br>
certainly never thought of seeing me so well off. Do you not know your<br>
old shadow? You certainly thought I should never more return. Things<br>
have gone on well with me since I was last with you. I have, in all<br>
respects, become very well off. Shall I purchase my freedom from<br>
service? If so, I can do it"; and then he rattled a whole bunch of<br>
valuable seals that hung to his watch, and he stuck his hand in the<br>
thick gold chain he wore around his neck--nay! how all his fingers<br>
glittered with diamond rings; and then all were pure gems.<br>
<br>
"Nay; I cannot recover from my surprise!" said the learned man.
"What is<br>
the meaning of all this?"<br>
<br>
"Something common, is it not," said the shadow. "But you
yourself do not<br>
belong to the common order; and I, as you know well, have from a child<br>
followed in your footsteps. As soon as you found I was capable to go<br>
out alone in the world, I went my own way. I am in the most brilliant<br>
circumstances, but there came a sort of desire over me to see you once<br>
more before you die; you will die, I suppose? I also wished to see this<br>
land again--for you know we always love our native land. I know you have<br>
got another shadow again; have I anything to pay to it or you? If so,<br>
you will oblige me by saying what it is."<br>
<br>
"Nay, is it really thou?" said the learned man. "It is most
remarkable:<br>
I never imagined that one's old shadow could come again as a man."<br>
<br>
"Tell me what I have to pay," said the shadow; "for I don't like
to be<br>
in any sort of debt."<br>
<br>
"How canst thou talk so?" said the learned man. "What debt is
there to<br>
talk about? Make thyself as free as anyone else. I am extremely glad to<br>
hear of thy good fortune: sit down, old friend, and tell me a little<br>
how it has gone with thee, and what thou hast seen at our opposite<br>
neighbor's there--in the warm lands."<br>
<br>
"Yes, I will tell you all about it," said the shadow, and sat down:
"but<br>
then you must also promise me, that, wherever you may meet me, you will<br>
never say to anyone here in the town that I have been your shadow. I<br>
intend to get betrothed, for I can provide for more than one family."<br>
<br>
"Be quite at thy ease about that," said the learned man; "I
shall not<br>
say to anyone who thou actually art: here is my hand--I promise it, and<br>
a man's bond is his word."<br>
<br>
"A word is a shadow," said the shadow, "and as such it must
speak."<br>
<br>
It was really quite astonishing how much of a man it was. It was dressed<br>
entirely in black, and of the very finest cloth; it had patent leather<br>
boots, and a hat that could be folded together, so that it was bare<br>
crown and brim; not to speak of what we already know it had--seals, gold<br>
neck-chain, and diamond rings; yes, the shadow was well-dressed, and it<br>
was just that which made it quite a man.<br>
<br>
"Now I shall tell you my adventures," said the shadow; and then he<br>
sat, with the polished boots, as heavily as he could, on the arm of the<br>
learned man's new shadow, which lay like a poodle-dog at his feet.<br>
Now this was perhaps from arrogance; and the shadow on the ground kept<br>
itself so still and quiet, that it might hear all that passed: it wished<br>
to know how it could get free, and work its way up, so as to become its<br>
own master.<br>
<br>
"Do you know who lived in our opposite neighbor's house?" said the<br>
shadow. "It was the most charming of all beings, it was Poesy! I was<br>
there for three weeks, and that has as much effect as if one had lived<br>
three thousand years, and read all that was composed and written;<br>
that is what I say, and it is right. I have seen everything and I know<br>
everything!"<br>
<br>
"Poesy!" cried the learned man. "Yes, yes, she often dwells a
recluse<br>
in large cities! Poesy! Yes, I have seen her--a single short moment,<br>
but sleep came into my eyes! She stood on the balcony and shone as the<br>
Aurora Borealis shines. Go on, go on--thou wert on the balcony, and went<br>
through the doorway, and then--"<br>
<br>
"Then I was in the antechamber," said the shadow. "You always
sat and<br>
looked over to the antechamber. There was no light; there was a sort<br>
of twilight, but the one door stood open directly opposite the other<br>
through a long row of rooms and saloons, and there it was lighted up. I<br>
should have been completely killed if I had gone over to the maiden; but<br>
I was circumspect, I took time to think, and that one must always do."<br>
<br>
"And what didst thou then see?" asked the learned man.<br>
<br>
"I saw everything, and I shall tell all to you: but--it is no pride on<br>
my part--as a free man, and with the knowledge I have, not to speak of<br>
my position in life, my excellent circumstances--I certainly wish that<br>
you would say YOU* to me!"<br>
<br>
* It is the custom in Denmark for intimate acquaintances to use the<br>
second person singular, "Du," (thou) when speaking to each other.
When<br>
a friendship is formed between men, they generally affirm it, when<br>
occasion offers, either in public or private, by drinking to each other<br>
and exclaiming, "thy health," at the same time striking their glasses<br>
together. This is called drinking "Duus": they are then, "Duus
Brodre,"<br>
(thou brothers) and ever afterwards use the pronoun "thou," to each<br>
other, it being regarded as more familiar than "De," (you). Father
and<br>
mother, sister and brother say thou to one another--without regard to<br>
age or rank. Master and mistress say thou to their servants the superior<br>
to the inferior. But servants and inferiors do not use the same term<br>
to their masters, or superiors--nor is it ever used when speaking to a<br>
stranger, or anyone with whom they are but slightly acquainted--they<br>
then say as in English--you.<br>

        <p>1. The learned man came from the cold lands. He was surprised that in the hot lands, people had to stay indoors with closed shutters and doors due to the intense heat.</p>
        <p>2. The learned man noticed that the house opposite his was quiet while the rest of the street was lively. The flowers on the balcony of that house seemed to shine like flames, and a slender maiden appeared among them, emitting a strange light.</p>
        <p>3. The learned man lost his shadow one night, and he was initially upset about it. After eight days, he noticed a new shadow gradually appearing and growing in the warm lands. Eventually, the shadow became long and large enough to satisfy the learned man.</p>

    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
"I beg your pardon," said the learned man; "it is an old habit
with me.<br>
YOU are perfectly right, and I shall remember it; but now you must tell<br>
me all YOU saw!"<br>
<br>
"Everything!" said the shadow. "For I saw everything, and I know<br>
everything!"<br>
<br>
"How did it look in the furthest saloon?" asked the learned man.
"Was it<br>
there as in the fresh woods? Was it there as in a holy church? Were the<br>
saloons like the starlit firmament when we stand on the high mountains?"<br>
<br>
"Everything was there!" said the shadow. "I did not go quite in,
I<br>
remained in the foremost room, in the twilight, but I stood there<br>
quite well; I saw everything, and I know everything! I have been in the<br>
antechamber at the court of Poesy."<br>
<br>
"But WHAT DID you see? Did all the gods of the olden times pass through<br>
the large saloons? Did the old heroes combat there? Did sweet children<br>
play there, and relate their dreams?"<br>
<br>
"I tell you I was there, and you can conceive that I saw everything<br>
there was to be seen. Had you come over there, you would not have been<br>
a man; but I became so! And besides, I learned to know my inward nature,<br>
my innate qualities, the relationship I had with Poesy. At the time I<br>
was with you, I thought not of that, but always--you know it well--when<br>
the sun rose, and when the sun went down, I became so strangely great;<br>
in the moonlight I was very near being more distinct than yourself; at<br>
that time I did not understand my nature; it was revealed to me in the<br>
antechamber! I became a man! I came out matured; but you were no longer<br>
in the warm lands; as a man I was ashamed to go as I did. I was in<br>
want of boots, of clothes, of the whole human varnish that makes a man<br>
perceptible. I took my way--I tell it to you, but you will not put it in<br>
any book--I took my way to the cake woman--I hid myself behind her;<br>
the woman didn't think how much she concealed. I went out first in the<br>
evening; I ran about the streets in the moonlight; I made myself long up<br>
the walls--it tickles the back so delightfully! I ran up, and ran down,<br>
peeped into the highest windows, into the saloons, and on the roofs, I<br>
peeped in where no one could peep, and I saw what no one else saw, what<br>
no one else should see! This is, in fact, a base world! I would not be a<br>
man if it were not now once accepted and regarded as something to be so!<br>
I saw the most unimaginable things with the women, with the men, with<br>
parents, and with the sweet, matchless children; I saw," said the<br>
shadow, "what no human being must know, but what they would all<br>
so willingly know--what is bad in their neighbor. Had I written a<br>
newspaper, it would have been read! But I wrote direct to the persons<br>
themselves, and there was consternation in all the towns where I came.<br>
They were so afraid of me, and yet they were so excessively fond of<br>
me. The professors made a professor of me; the tailors gave me new<br>
clothes--I am well furnished; the master of the mint struck new coin for<br>
me, and the women said I was so handsome! And so I became the man I am.<br>
And I now bid you farewell. Here is my card--I live on the sunny side<br>
of the street, and am always at home in rainy weather!" And so away went<br>
the shadow. "That was most extraordinary!" said the learned man.
Years<br>
and days passed away, then the shadow came again. "How goes it?" said<br>
the shadow.<br>
<br>
"Alas!" said the learned man. "I write about the true, and the
good,<br>
and the beautiful, but no one cares to hear such things; I am quite<br>
desperate, for I take it so much to heart!"<br>
<br>
"But I don't!" said the shadow. "I become fat, and it is that
one wants<br>
to become! You do not understand the world. You will become ill by it.<br>
You must travel! I shall make a tour this summer; will you go with me?<br>
I should like to have a travelling companion! Will you go with me, as<br>
shadow? It will be a great pleasure for me to have you with me; I shall<br>
pay the travelling expenses!"<br>
<br>
"Nay, this is too much!" said the learned man.<br>
<br>
"It is just as one takes it!" said the shadow. "It will do you
much good<br>
to travel! Will you be my shadow? You shall have everything free on the<br>
journey!"<br>
<br>
"Nay, that is too bad!" said the learned man.<br>
<br>
"But it is just so with the world!" said the shadow, "and so it
will<br>
be!" and away it went again.<br>
<br>
The learned man was not at all in the most enviable state; grief and<br>
torment followed him, and what he said about the true, and the good, and<br>
the beautiful, was, to most persons, like roses for a cow! He was quite<br>
ill at last.<br>
<br>
"You really look like a shadow!" said his friends to him; and the<br>
learned man trembled, for he thought of it.<br>
<br>
"You must go to a watering-place!" said the shadow, who came and
visited<br>
him. "There is nothing else for it! I will take you with me for old<br>
acquaintance' sake; I will pay the travelling expenses, and you write<br>
the descriptions--and if they are a little amusing for me on the way!<br>
I will go to a watering-place--my beard does not grow out as it<br>
ought--that is also a sickness--and one must have a beard! Now you be<br>
wise and accept the offer; we shall travel as comrades!"<br>
<br>
And so they travelled; the shadow was master, and the master was the<br>
shadow; they drove with each other, they rode and walked together, side<br>
by side, before and behind, just as the sun was; the shadow always took<br>
care to keep itself in the master's place. Now the learned man didn't<br>
think much about that; he was a very kind-hearted man, and particularly<br>
mild and friendly, and so he said one day to the shadow: "As we have<br>
now become companions, and in this way have grown up together from<br>
childhood, shall we not drink 'thou' together, it is more familiar?"<br>
<br>
"You are right," said the shadow, who was now the proper master.
"It is<br>
said in a very straight-forward and well-meant manner. You, as a learned<br>
man, certainly know how strange nature is. Some persons cannot bear to<br>
touch grey paper, or they become ill; others shiver in every limb if one<br>
rub a pane of glass with a nail: I have just such a feeling on hearing<br>
you say thou to me; I feel myself as if pressed to the earth in my first<br>
situation with you. You see that it is a feeling; that it is not pride:<br>
I cannot allow you to say THOU to me, but I will willingly say THOU to<br>
you, so it is half done!"<br>
<br>
So the shadow said THOU to its former master.<br>
<br>
"This is rather too bad," thought he, "that I must say YOU and
he say<br>
THOU," but he was now obliged to put up with it.<br>
<br>
So they came to a watering-place where there were many strangers, and<br>
amongst them was a princess, who was troubled with seeing too well; and<br>
that was so alarming!<br>
<br>
She directly observed that the stranger who had just come was quite a<br>
different sort of person to all the others; "He has come here in order<br>
to get his beard to grow, they say, but I see the real cause, he cannot<br>
cast a shadow."<br>
<br>
She had become inquisitive; and so she entered into conversation<br>
directly with the strange gentleman, on their promenades. As the<br>
daughter of a king, she needed not to stand upon trifles, so she said,<br>
"Your complaint is, that you cannot cast a shadow?"<br>
<br>
"Your Royal Highness must be improving considerably," said the
shadow,<br>
"I know your complaint is, that you see too clearly, but it has<br>
decreased, you are cured. I just happen to have a very unusual shadow!<br>
Do you not see that person who always goes with me? Other persons have<br>
a common shadow, but I do not like what is common to all. We give our<br>
servants finer cloth for their livery than we ourselves use, and so I<br>
had my shadow trimmed up into a man: yes, you see I have even given him<br>
a shadow. It is somewhat expensive, but I like to have something for<br>
myself!"<br>
<br>
"What!" thought the princess. "Should I really be cured! These
baths are<br>
the first in the world! In our time water has wonderful powers. But I<br>
shall not leave the place, for it now begins to be amusing here. I am<br>
extremely fond of that stranger: would that his beard should not grow,<br>
for in that case he will leave us!"<br>
<br>
In the evening, the princess and the shadow danced together in the large<br>
ball-room. She was light, but he was still lighter; she had never had<br>
such a partner in the dance. She told him from what land she came, and<br>
he knew that land; he had been there, but then she was not at home; he<br>
had peeped in at the window, above and below--he had seen both the<br>
one and the other, and so he could answer the princess, and make<br>
insinuations, so that she was quite astonished; he must be the wisest<br>
man in the whole world! She felt such respect for what he knew! So that<br>
when they again danced together she fell in love with him; and that the<br>
shadow could remark, for she almost pierced him through with her eyes.<br>
So they danced once more together; and she was about to declare herself,<br>
but she was discreet; she thought of her country and kingdom, and of the<br>
many persons she would have to reign over.<br>
<br>
"He is a wise man," said she to herself--"It is well; and he
dances<br>
delightfully--that is also good; but has he solid knowledge? That is<br>
just as important! He must be examined."<br>
<br>
So she began, by degrees, to question him about the most difficult<br>
things she could think of, and which she herself could not have<br>
answered; so that the shadow made a strange face.<br>
<br>
"You cannot answer these questions?" said the princess.<br>
<br>
"They belong to my childhood's learning," said the shadow. "I
really<br>
believe my shadow, by the door there, can answer them!"<br>
<br>
"Your shadow!" said the princess. "That would indeed be
marvellous!"<br>
<br>
"I will not say for a certainty that he can," said the shadow,
"but I<br>
think so; he has now followed me for so many years, and listened to my<br>
conversation--I should think it possible. But your royal highness will<br>
permit me to observe, that he is so proud of passing himself off for<br>
a man, that when he is to be in a proper humor--and he must be so to<br>
answer well--he must be treated quite like a man."<br>
<br>
"Oh! I like that!" said the princess.<br>
<br>
So she went to the learned man by the door, and she spoke to him about<br>
the sun and the moon, and about persons out of and in the world, and he<br>
answered with wisdom and prudence.<br>
<br>
"What a man that must be who has so wise a shadow!" thought she.
"It<br>
will be a real blessing to my people and kingdom if I choose him for my<br>
consort--I will do it!"<br>
<br>
They were soon agreed, both the princess and the shadow; but no one was<br>
to know about it before she arrived in her own kingdom.<br>
<br>
"No one--not even my shadow!" said the shadow, and he had his own<br>
thoughts about it!<br>
<br>
Now they were in the country where the princess reigned when she was at<br>
home.<br>
<br>
"Listen, my good friend," said the shadow to the learned man. "I
have<br>
now become as happy and mighty as anyone can be; I will, therefore, do<br>
something particular for thee! Thou shalt always live with me in the<br>
palace, drive with me in my royal carriage, and have ten thousand<br>
pounds a year; but then thou must submit to be called SHADOW by all and<br>
everyone; thou must not say that thou hast ever been a man; and once<br>
a year, when I sit on the balcony in the sunshine, thou must lie at my<br>
feet, as a shadow shall do! I must tell thee: I am going to marry the<br>
king's daughter, and the nuptials are to take place this evening!"<br>
<br>
"Nay, this is going too far!" said the learned man. "I will not
have it;<br>
I will not do it! It is to deceive the whole country and the princess<br>
too! I will tell everything! That I am a man, and that thou art a<br>
shadow--thou art only dressed up!"<br>
<br>
"There is no one who will believe it!" said the shadow. "Be
reasonable,<br>
or I will call the guard!"<br>
<br>
"I will go directly to the princess!" said the learned man.<br>
<br>
"But I will go first!" said the shadow. "And thou wilt go to
prison!"<br>
and that he was obliged to do--for the sentinels obeyed him whom they<br>
knew the king's daughter was to marry.<br>
<br>
"You tremble!" said the princess, as the shadow came into her
chamber.<br>
"Has anything happened? You must not be unwell this evening, now that we<br>
are to have our nuptials celebrated."<br>
<br>
"I have lived to see the most cruel thing that anyone can live to<br>
see!" said the shadow. "Only imagine--yes, it is true, such a poor<br>
shadow-skull cannot bear much--only think, my shadow has become mad;<br>
he thinks that he is a man, and that I--now only think--that I am his<br>
shadow!"<br>
<br>
"It is terrible!" said the princess; "but he is confined, is he
not?"<br>
<br>
"That he is. I am afraid that he will never recover."<br>
<br>
"Poor shadow!" said the princess. "He is very unfortunate; it
would be<br>
a real work of charity to deliver him from the little life he has, and,<br>
when I think properly over the matter, I am of opinion that it will be<br>
necessary to do away with him in all stillness!"<br>
<br>
"It is certainly hard," said the shadow, "for he was a faithful<br>
servant!" and then he gave a sort of sigh.<br>
<br>
"You are a noble character!" said the princess.<br>
<br>
The whole city was illuminated in the evening, and the cannons went off<br>
with a bum! bum! and the soldiers presented arms. That was a marriage!<br>
The princess and the shadow went out on the balcony to show themselves,<br>
and get another hurrah!<br>
<br>
The learned man heard nothing of all this--for they had deprived him of<br>
life.<br>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL | THE DREAM OF LITTLE TUK</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL<br>
<br>
Most terribly cold it was; it snowed, and was nearly quite dark, and<br>
evening--the last evening of the year. In this cold and darkness there<br>
went along the street a poor little girl, bareheaded, and with naked<br>
feet. When she left home she had slippers on, it is true; but what was<br>
the good of that? They were very large slippers, which her mother had<br>
hitherto worn; so large were they; and the poor little thing lost them<br>
as she scuffled away across the street, because of two carriages that<br>
rolled by dreadfully fast.<br>
<br>
One slipper was nowhere to be found; the other had been laid hold of by<br>
an urchin, and off he ran with it; he thought it would do capitally for<br>
a cradle when he some day or other should have children himself. So the<br>
little maiden walked on with her tiny naked feet, that were quite red<br>
and blue from cold. She carried a quantity of matches in an old apron,<br>
and she held a bundle of them in her hand. Nobody had bought anything of<br>
her the whole livelong day; no one had given her a single farthing.<br>
<br>
She crept along trembling with cold and hunger--a very picture of<br>
sorrow, the poor little thing!<br>
<br>
The flakes of snow covered her long fair hair, which fell in beautiful<br>
curls around her neck; but of that, of course, she never once now<br>
thought. From all the windows the candles were gleaming, and it smelt so<br>
deliciously of roast goose, for you know it was New Year's Eve; yes, of<br>
that she thought.<br>
<br>
In a corner formed by two houses, of which one advanced more than the<br>
other, she seated herself down and cowered together. Her little feet<br>
she had drawn close up to her, but she grew colder and colder, and to go<br>
home she did not venture, for she had not sold any matches and could<br>
not bring a farthing of money: from her father she would certainly get<br>
blows, and at home it was cold too, for above her she had only the roof,<br>
through which the wind whistled, even though the largest cracks were<br>
stopped up with straw and rags.<br>
<br>
Her little hands were almost numbed with cold. Oh! a match might afford<br>
her a world of comfort, if she only dared take a single one out of the<br>
bundle, draw it against the wall, and warm her fingers by it. She drew<br>
one out. "Rischt!" how it blazed, how it burnt! It was a warm, bright<br>
flame, like a candle, as she held her hands over it: it was a wonderful<br>
light. It seemed really to the little maiden as though she were sitting<br>
before a large iron stove, with burnished brass feet and a brass<br>
ornament at top. The fire burned with such blessed influence; it warmed<br>
so delightfully. The little girl had already stretched out her feet to<br>
warm them too; but--the small flame went out, the stove vanished: she<br>
had only the remains of the burnt-out match in her hand.<br>
<br>
She rubbed another against the wall: it burned brightly, and where the<br>
light fell on the wall, there the wall became transparent like a<br>
veil, so that she could see into the room. On the table was spread a<br>
snow-white tablecloth; upon it was a splendid porcelain service, and the<br>
roast goose was steaming famously with its stuffing of apple and dried<br>
plums. And what was still more capital to behold was, the goose hopped<br>
down from the dish, reeled about on the floor with knife and fork in its<br>
breast, till it came up to the poor little girl; when--the match went<br>
out and nothing but the thick, cold, damp wall was left behind.<br>
She lighted another match. Now there she was sitting under the most<br>
magnificent Christmas tree: it was still larger, and more decorated than<br>
the one which she had seen through the glass door in the rich merchant's<br>
house.<br>
<br>
Thousands of lights were burning on the green branches, and<br>
gaily-colored pictures, such as she had seen in the shop-windows, looked<br>
down upon her. The little maiden stretched out her hands towards them<br>
when--the match went out. The lights of the Christmas tree rose higher<br>
and higher, she saw them now as stars in heaven; one fell down and<br>
formed a long trail of fire.<br>
<br>
"Someone is just dead!" said the little girl; for her old
grandmother,<br>
the only person who had loved her, and who was now no more, had told<br>
her, that when a star falls, a soul ascends to God.<br>
<br>
She drew another match against the wall: it was again light, and in the<br>
lustre there stood the old grandmother, so bright and radiant, so mild,<br>
and with such an expression of love.<br>
<br>
"Grandmother!" cried the little one. "Oh, take me with you! You
go<br>
away when the match burns out; you vanish like the warm stove, like the<br>
delicious roast goose, and like the magnificent Christmas tree!" And<br>
she rubbed the whole bundle of matches quickly against the wall, for<br>
she wanted to be quite sure of keeping her grandmother near her. And<br>
the matches gave such a brilliant light that it was brighter than at<br>
noon-day: never formerly had the grandmother been so beautiful and<br>
so tall. She took the little maiden, on her arm, and both flew in<br>
brightness and in joy so high, so very high, and then above was neither<br>
cold, nor hunger, nor anxiety--they were with God.<br>
<br>
But in the corner, at the cold hour of dawn, sat the poor girl, with<br>
rosy cheeks and with a smiling mouth, leaning against the wall--frozen<br>
to death on the last evening of the old year. Stiff and stark sat the<br>
child there with her matches, of which one bundle had been burnt. "She<br>
wanted to warm herself," people said. No one had the slightest suspicion<br>
of what beautiful things she had seen; no one even dreamed of the<br>
splendor in which, with her grandmother she had entered on the joys of a<br>
new year.<br>

THE DREAM OF LITTLE TUK<br>
<br>
Ah! yes, that was little Tuk: in reality his name was not Tuk, but that<br>
was what he called himself before he could speak plain: he meant it for<br>
Charles, and it is all well enough if one does but know it. He had now<br>
to take care of his little sister Augusta, who was much younger than<br>
himself, and he was, besides, to learn his lesson at the same time; but<br>
these two things would not do together at all. There sat the poor little<br>
fellow, with his sister on his lap, and he sang to her all the songs he<br>
knew; and he glanced the while from time to time into the geography-book<br>
that lay open before him. By the next morning he was to have learnt<br>
all the towns in Zealand by heart, and to know about them all that is<br>
possible to be known.<br>
<br>
His mother now came home, for she had been out, and took little Augusta<br>
on her arm. Tuk ran quickly to the window, and read so eagerly that he<br>
pretty nearly read his eyes out; for it got darker and darker, but his<br>
mother had no money to buy a candle.<br>
<br>
"There goes the old washerwoman over the way," said his mother, as
she<br>
looked out of the window. "The poor woman can hardly drag herself along,<br>
and she must now drag the pail home from the fountain. Be a good boy,<br>
Tukey, and run across and help the old woman, won't you?"<br>
<br>
So Tuk ran over quickly and helped her; but when he came back again into<br>
the room it was quite dark, and as to a light, there was no thought of<br>
such a thing. He was now to go to bed; that was an old turn-up bedstead;<br>
in it he lay and thought about his geography lesson, and of Zealand, and<br>
of all that his master had told him. He ought, to be sure, to have read<br>
over his lesson again, but that, you know, he could not do. He therefore<br>
put his geography-book under his pillow, because he had heard that was<br>
a very good thing to do when one wants to learn one's lesson; but one<br>
cannot, however, rely upon it entirely. Well, there he lay, and thought<br>
and thought, and all at once it was just as if someone kissed his eyes<br>
and mouth: he slept, and yet he did not sleep; it was as though the old<br>
washerwoman gazed on him with her mild eyes and said, "It were a great<br>
sin if you were not to know your lesson tomorrow morning. You have aided<br>
me, I therefore will now help you; and the loving God will do so at all<br>
times." And all of a sudden the book under Tuk's pillow began scraping<br>
and scratching.<br>
<br>
"Kickery-ki! kluk! kluk! kluk!"--that was an old hen who came
creeping<br>
along, and she was from Kjoge. "I am a Kjoger hen," [*] said she, and
then<br>
she related how many inhabitants there were there, and about the battle<br>
that had taken place, and which, after all, was hardly worth talking<br>
about.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Kjoge, a town in the bay of Kjoge. "To see the Kjoge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hens," is an expression similar to "showing a child
London,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which is said to be done by taking his head in both bands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and so lifting him off the ground. At the invasion of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; English in 1807, an encounter of a no very glorious nature<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; took place between the British troops and the undisciplined<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danish militia.<br>
<br>
"Kribledy, krabledy--plump!" down fell somebody: it was a wooden
bird,<br>
the popinjay used at the shooting-matches at Prastoe. Now he said that<br>
there were just as many inhabitants as he had nails in his body; and he<br>
was very proud. "Thorwaldsen lived almost next door to me.* Plump! Here<br>
I lie capitally."<br>
<br>
* Prastoe, a still smaller town than Kjoge. Some hundred paces from<br>
it lies the manor-house Ny Soe, where Thorwaldsen, the famed sculptor,<br>
generally sojourned during his stay in Denmark, and where he called many<br>
of his immortal works into existence.<br>
<br>
<br>
But little Tuk was no longer lying down: all at once he was on<br>
horseback. On he went at full gallop, still galloping on and on. A<br>
knight with a gleaming plume, and most magnificently dressed, held him<br>
before him on the horse, and thus they rode through the wood to the old<br>
town of Bordingborg, and that was a large and very lively town. High<br>
towers rose from the castle of the king, and the brightness of many<br>
candles streamed from all the windows; within was dance and song,<br>
and King Waldemar and the young, richly-attired maids of honor danced<br>
together. The morn now came; and as soon as the sun appeared, the whole<br>
town and the king's palace crumbled together, and one tower after the<br>
other; and at last only a single one remained standing where the castle<br>
had been before,* and the town was so small and poor, and the school<br>
boys came along with their books under their arms, and said, "2000<br>
inhabitants!" but that was not true, for there were not so many.<br>
<br>
*Bordingborg, in the reign of King Waldemar, a considerable place, now<br>
an unimportant little town. One solitary tower only, and some remains of<br>
a wall, show where the castle once stood.<br>
<br>
<br>
And little Tukey lay in his bed: it seemed to him as if he dreamed, and<br>
yet as if he were not dreaming; however, somebody was close beside him.<br>
<br>
"Little Tukey! Little Tukey!" cried someone near. It was a seaman,<br>
quite a little personage, so little as if he were a midshipman; but a<br>
midshipman it was not.<br>
<br>
"Many remembrances from Corsor.* That is a town that is just rising<br>
into importance; a lively town that has steam-boats and stagecoaches:<br>
formerly people called it ugly, but that is no longer true. I lie on<br>
the sea," said Corsor; "I have high roads and gardens, and I have
given<br>
birth to a poet who was witty and amusing, which all poets are not. I<br>
once intended to equip a ship that was to sail all round the earth; but<br>
I did not do it, although I could have done so: and then, too, I smell<br>
so deliciously, for close before the gate bloom the most beautiful<br>
roses."<br>
<br>
*Corsor, on the Great Belt, called, formerly, before the introduction<br>
of steam-vessels, when travellers were often obliged to wait a long time<br>
for a favorable wind, "the most tiresome of towns." The poet Baggesen<br>
was born here.<br>
<br>
<br>
Little Tuk looked, and all was red and green before his eyes; but as<br>
soon as the confusion of colors was somewhat over, all of a sudden there<br>
appeared a wooded slope close to the bay, and high up above stood a<br>
magnificent old church, with two high pointed towers. From out the<br>
hill-side spouted fountains in thick streams of water, so that there<br>
was a continual splashing; and close beside them sat an old king with<br>
a golden crown upon his white head: that was King Hroar, near the<br>
fountains, close to the town of Roeskilde, as it is now called. And up<br>
the slope into the old church went all the kings and queens of Denmark,<br>
hand in hand, all with their golden crowns; and the organ played and<br>
the fountains rustled. Little Tuk saw all, heard all. "Do not forget the<br>
diet," said King Hroar.*<br>
<br>
*Roeskilde, once the capital of Denmark. The town takes its name from<br>
King Hroar, and the many fountains in the neighborhood. In the beautiful<br>
cathedral the greater number of the kings and queens of Denmark are<br>
interred. In Roeskilde, too, the members of the Danish Diet assemble.<br>
<br>
<br>
Again all suddenly disappeared. Yes, and whither? It seemed to him<br>
just as if one turned over a leaf in a book. And now stood there an<br>
old peasant-woman, who came from Soroe,* where grass grows in the<br>
market-place. She had an old grey linen apron hanging over her head and<br>
back: it was so wet, it certainly must have been raining. "Yes, that it<br>
has," said she; and she now related many pretty things out of Holberg's<br>
comedies, and about Waldemar and Absalon; but all at once she cowered<br>
together, and her head began shaking backwards and forwards, and she<br>
looked as she were going to make a spring. "Croak! croak!" said she.<br>
"It is wet, it is wet; there is such a pleasant deathlike stillness in<br>
Sorbe!" She was now suddenly a frog, "Croak"; and now she was an
old<br>
woman. "One must dress according to the weather," said she. "It
is wet;<br>
it is wet. My town is just like a bottle; and one gets in by the neck,<br>
and by the neck one must get out again! In former times I had the<br>
finest fish, and now I have fresh rosy-cheeked boys at the bottom of the<br>
bottle, who learn wisdom, Hebrew, Greek--Croak!"<br>
<br>
* Sorbe, a very quiet little town, beautifully situated, surrounded by<br>
woods and lakes. Holberg, Denmark's Moliere, founded here an academy<br>
for the sons of the nobles. The poets Hauch and Ingemann were appointed<br>
professors here. The latter lives there still.<br>
<br>
<br>
When she spoke it sounded just like the noise of frogs, or as if one<br>
walked with great boots over a moor; always the same tone, so uniform<br>
and so tiring that little Tuk fell into a good sound sleep, which, by<br>
the bye, could not do him any harm.<br>
<br>
But even in this sleep there came a dream, or whatever else it was: his<br>
little sister Augusta, she with the blue eyes and the fair curling hair,<br>
was suddenly a tall, beautiful girl, and without having wings was yet<br>
able to fly; and she now flew over Zealand--over the green woods and the<br>
blue lakes.<br>
<br>
"Do you hear the cock crow, Tukey? Cock-a-doodle-doo! The cocks are<br>
flying up from Kjoge! You will have a farm-yard, so large, oh! so very<br>
large! You will suffer neither hunger nor thirst! You will get on in the<br>
world! You will be a rich and happy man! Your house will exalt itself<br>
like King Waldemar's tower, and will be richly decorated with marble<br>
statues, like that at Prastoe. You understand what I mean. Your name<br>
shall circulate with renown all round the earth, like unto the ship that<br>
was to have sailed from Corsor; and in Roeskilde--"<br>
<br>
"Do not forget the diet!" said King Hroar.<br>
<br>
"Then you will speak well and wisely, little Tukey; and when at last you<br>
sink into your grave, you shall sleep as quietly--"<br>
<br>
"As if I lay in Soroe," said Tuk, awaking. It was bright day, and he
was<br>
now quite unable to call to mind his dream; that, however, was not at<br>
all necessary, for one may not know what the future will bring.<br>
<br>
And out of bed he jumped, and read in his book, and now all at once he<br>
knew his whole lesson. And the old washerwoman popped her head in at the<br>
door, nodded to him friendly, and said, "Thanks, many thanks, my good<br>
child, for your help! May the good ever-loving God fulfil your loveliest<br>
dream!"<br>
<br>
Little Tukey did not at all know what he had dreamed, but the loving God<br>
knew it.<br>
