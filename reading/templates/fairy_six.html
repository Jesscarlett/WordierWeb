    <p class="w3-large"><strong>THE HAPPY FAMILY</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
Really, the largest green leaf in this country is a dock-leaf; if one<br>
holds it before one, it is like a whole apron, and if one holds it over<br>
one's head in rainy weather, it is almost as good as an umbrella, for<br>
it is so immensely large. The burdock never grows alone, but where there<br>
grows one there always grow several: it is a great delight, and all this<br>
delightfulness is snails' food. The great white snails which persons of<br>
quality in former times made fricassees of, ate, and said, "Hem,<br>
hem! how delicious!" for they thought it tasted so delicate--lived on<br>
dock-leaves, and therefore burdock seeds were sown.<br>
<br>
Now, there was an old manor-house, where they no longer ate snails, they<br>
were quite extinct; but the burdocks were not extinct, they grew and<br>
grew all over the walks and all the beds; they could not get the mastery<br>
over them--it was a whole forest of burdocks. Here and there stood an<br>
apple and a plum-tree, or else one never would have thought that it was<br>
a garden; all was burdocks, and there lived the two last venerable old<br>
snails.<br>
<br>
They themselves knew not how old they were, but they could remember<br>
very well that there had been many more; that they were of a family<br>
from foreign lands, and that for them and theirs the whole forest was<br>
planted. They had never been outside it, but they knew that there was<br>
still something more in the world, which was called the manor-house, and<br>
that there they were boiled, and then they became black, and were then<br>
placed on a silver dish; but what happened further they knew not; or, in<br>
fact, what it was to be boiled, and to lie on a silver dish, they could<br>
not possibly imagine; but it was said to be delightful, and particularly<br>
genteel. Neither the chafers, the toads, nor the earth-worms, whom they<br>
asked about it could give them any information--none of them had been<br>
boiled or laid on a silver dish.<br>
<br>
The old white snails were the first persons of distinction in the<br>
world, that they knew; the forest was planted for their sake, and the<br>
manor-house was there that they might be boiled and laid on a silver<br>
dish.<br>
<br>
Now they lived a very lonely and happy life; and as they had no children<br>
themselves, they had adopted a little common snail, which they brought<br>
up as their own; but the little one would not grow, for he was of a<br>
common family; but the old ones, especially Dame Mother Snail, thought<br>
they could observe how he increased in size, and she begged father,<br>
if he could not see it, that he would at least feel the little snail's<br>
shell; and then he felt it, and found the good dame was right.<br>
<br>
One day there was a heavy storm of rain.<br>
<br>
"Hear how it beats like a drum on the dock-leaves!" said Father
Snail.<br>
<br>
"There are also rain-drops!" said Mother Snail. "And now the
rain pours<br>
right down the stalk! You will see that it will be wet here! I am very<br>
happy to think that we have our good house, and the little one has<br>
his also! There is more done for us than for all other creatures, sure<br>
enough; but can you not see that we are folks of quality in the world?<br>
We are provided with a house from our birth, and the burdock forest is<br>
planted for our sakes! I should like to know how far it extends, and<br>
what there is outside!"<br>
<br>
"There is nothing at all," said Father Snail. "No place can be
better<br>
than ours, and I have nothing to wish for!"<br>
<br>
"Yes," said the dame. "I would willingly go to the manorhouse,
be<br>
boiled, and laid on a silver dish; all our forefathers have been treated<br>
so; there is something extraordinary in it, you may be sure!"<br>
<br>
"The manor-house has most likely fallen to ruin!" said Father Snail.
"Or<br>
the burdocks have grown up over it, so that they cannot come out. There<br>
need not, however, be any haste about that; but you are always in such a<br>
tremendous hurry, and the little one is beginning to be the same. Has he<br>
not been creeping up that stalk these three days? It gives me a headache<br>
when I look up to him!"<br>
<br>
"You must not scold him," said Mother Snail. "He creeps so
carefully; he<br>
will afford us much pleasure--and we have nothing but him to live for!<br>
But have you not thought of it? Where shall we get a wife for him? Do<br>
you not think that there are some of our species at a great distance in<br>
the interior of the burdock forest?"<br>
<br>
"Black snails, I dare say, there are enough of," said the old one.<br>
"Black snails without a house--but they are so common, and so conceited.<br>
But we might give the ants a commission to look out for us; they run<br>
to and fro as if they had something to do, and they certainly know of a<br>
wife for our little snail!"<br>
<br>
"I know one, sure enough--the most charming one!" said one of the
ants.<br>
"But I am afraid we shall hardly succeed, for she is a queen!"<br>
<br>
"That is nothing!" said the old folks. "Has she a house?"<br>
<br>
"She has a palace!" said the ant. "The finest ant's palace, with
seven<br>
hundred passages!"<br>
<br>
"I thank you!" said Mother Snail. "Our son shall not go into an<br>
ant-hill; if you know nothing better than that, we shall give the<br>
commission to the white gnats. They fly far and wide, in rain and<br>
sunshine; they know the whole forest here, both within and without."<br>
<br>
"We have a wife for him," said the gnats. "At a hundred human
paces from<br>
here there sits a little snail in her house, on a gooseberry bush; she<br>
is quite lonely, and old enough to be married. It is only a hundred<br>
human paces!"<br>
<br>
"Well, then, let her come to him!" said the old ones. "He has a
whole<br>
forest of burdocks, she has only a bush!"<br>
<br>
And so they went and fetched little Miss Snail. It was a whole week<br>
before she arrived; but therein was just the very best of it, for one<br>
could thus see that she was of the same species.<br>
<br>
And then the marriage was celebrated. Six earth-worms shone as well as<br>
they could. In other respects the whole went off very quietly, for the<br>
old folks could not bear noise and merriment; but old Dame Snail made<br>
a brilliant speech. Father Snail could not speak, he was too much<br>
affected; and so they gave them as a dowry and inheritance, the whole<br>
forest of burdocks, and said--what they had always said--that it was<br>
the best in the world; and if they lived honestly and decently, and<br>
increased and multiplied, they and their children would once in the<br>
course of time come to the manor-house, be boiled black, and laid on<br>
silver dishes. After this speech was made, the old ones crept into their<br>
shells, and never more came out. They slept; the young couple governed<br>
in the forest, and had a numerous progeny, but they were never boiled,<br>
and never came on the silver dishes; so from this they concluded that<br>
the manor-house had fallen to ruins, and that all the men in the world<br>
were extinct; and as no one contradicted them, so, of course it was so.<br>
And the rain beat on the dock-leaves to make drum-music for their sake,<br>
and the sun shone in order to give the burdock forest a color for their<br>
sakes; and they were very happy, and the whole family was happy; for<br>
they, indeed were so.<br>

        <p>1. The largest green leaf is a dock-leaf. It is described as being like a whole apron when held before someone, and when held over the head in rainy weather, it acts almost as good as an umbrella due to its immense size.</p>
        <p>2. The main characters are the old white snails and their adopted little common snail. The old snails believe they are of a special, distinguished species, and the entire forest of burdocks is planted for their sake. They dream of being boiled and laid on a silver dish at the manor-house.</p>
        <p>3. The snails first consider ants and then white gnats to find a wife for their little snail. The white gnats eventually suggest a suitable match—a little snail sitting on a gooseberry bush a hundred paces away. They bring her, and the marriage is celebrated, with the dowry being the whole forest of burdocks.</p>

<div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:30px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px;">
    <p class="w3-large"><strong>THE STORY OF A MOTHER</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
A mother sat there with her little child. She was so downcast, so<br>
afraid that it should die! It was so pale, the small eyes had closed<br>
themselves, and it drew its breath so softly, now and then, with a<br>
deep respiration, as if it sighed; and the mother looked still more<br>
sorrowfully on the little creature.<br>
<br>
Then a knocking was heard at the door, and in came a poor old man<br>
wrapped up as in a large horse-cloth, for it warms one, and he needed<br>
it, as it was the cold winter season! Everything out-of-doors was<br>
covered with ice and snow, and the wind blew so that it cut the face.<br>
<br>
As the old man trembled with cold, and the little child slept a moment,<br>
the mother went and poured some ale into a pot and set it on the stove,<br>
that it might be warm for him; the old man sat and rocked the cradle,<br>
and the mother sat down on a chair close by him, and looked at her<br>
little sick child that drew its breath so deep, and raised its little<br>
hand.<br>
<br>
"Do you not think that I shall save him?" said she. "Our Lord
will not<br>
take him from me!"<br>
<br>
And the old man--it was Death himself--he nodded so strangely, it could<br>
just as well signify yes as no. And the mother looked down in her lap,<br>
and the tears ran down over her cheeks; her head became so heavy--she<br>
had not closed her eyes for three days and nights; and now she slept,<br>
but only for a minute, when she started up and trembled with cold.<br>
<br>
"What is that?" said she, and looked on all sides; but the old man
was<br>
gone, and her little child was gone--he had taken it with him; and the<br>
old clock in the corner burred, and burred, the great leaden weight ran<br>
down to the floor, bump! and then the clock also stood still.<br>
<br>
But the poor mother ran out of the house and cried aloud for her child.<br>
<br>
Out there, in the midst of the snow, there sat a woman in long, black<br>
clothes; and she said, "Death has been in thy chamber, and I saw him<br>
hasten away with thy little child; he goes faster than the wind, and he<br>
never brings back what he takes!"<br>
<br>
"Oh, only tell me which way he went!" said the mother. "Tell me
the way,<br>
and I shall find him!"<br>
<br>
"I know it!" said the woman in the black clothes. "But before I
tell it,<br>
thou must first sing for me all the songs thou hast sung for thy child!<br>
I am fond of them. I have heard them before; I am Night; I saw thy tears<br>
whilst thou sang'st them!"<br>
<br>
"I will sing them all, all!" said the mother. "But do not stop
me now--I<br>
may overtake him--I may find my child!"<br>
<br>
But Night stood still and mute. Then the mother wrung her hands, sang<br>
and wept, and there were many songs, but yet many more tears; and then<br>
Night said, "Go to the right, into the dark pine forest; thither I saw<br>
Death take his way with thy little child!"<br>
<br>
The roads crossed each other in the depths of the forest, and she no<br>
longer knew whither she should go! then there stood a thorn-bush;<br>
there was neither leaf nor flower on it, it was also in the cold winter<br>
season, and ice-flakes hung on the branches.<br>
<br>
"Hast thou not seen Death go past with my little child?" said the<br>
mother.<br>
<br>
"Yes," said the thorn-bush; "but I will not tell thee which way
he took,<br>
unless thou wilt first warm me up at thy heart. I am freezing to death;<br>
I shall become a lump of ice!"<br>
<br>
And she pressed the thorn-bush to her breast, so firmly, that it might<br>
be thoroughly warmed, and the thorns went right into her flesh, and her<br>
blood flowed in large drops, but the thornbush shot forth fresh green<br>
leaves, and there came flowers on it in the cold winter night, the heart<br>
of the afflicted mother was so warm; and the thorn-bush told her the way<br>
she should go.<br>
<br>
She then came to a large lake, where there was neither ship nor boat.<br>
The lake was not frozen sufficiently to bear her; neither was it open,<br>
nor low enough that she could wade through it; and across it she must go<br>
if she would find her child! Then she lay down to drink up the lake, and<br>
that was an impossibility for a human being, but the afflicted mother<br>
thought that a miracle might happen nevertheless.<br>
<br>
"Oh, what would I not give to come to my child!" said the weeping<br>
mother; and she wept still more, and her eyes sunk down in the depths of<br>
the waters, and became two precious pearls; but the water bore her up,<br>
as if she sat in a swing, and she flew in the rocking waves to the shore<br>
on the opposite side, where there stood a mile-broad, strange house, one<br>
knew not if it were a mountain with forests and caverns, or if it were<br>
built up; but the poor mother could not see it; she had wept her eyes<br>
out.<br>
<br>
"Where shall I find Death, who took away my little child?" said she.<br>
<br>
"He has not come here yet!" said the old grave woman, who was
appointed<br>
to look after Death's great greenhouse! "How have you been able to find<br>
the way hither? And who has helped you?"<br>
<br>
"OUR LORD has helped me," said she. "He is merciful, and you
will also<br>
be so! Where shall I find my little child?"<br>
<br>
"Nay, I know not," said the woman, "and you cannot see! Many
flowers and<br>
trees have withered this night; Death will soon come and plant them over<br>
again! You certainly know that every person has his or her life's tree<br>
or flower, just as everyone happens to be settled; they look like other<br>
plants, but they have pulsations of the heart. Children's hearts can<br>
also beat; go after yours, perhaps you may know your child's; but what<br>
will you give me if I tell you what you shall do more?"<br>
<br>
"I have nothing to give," said the afflicted mother, "but I will
go to<br>
the world's end for you!"<br>
<br>
"Nay, I have nothing to do there!" said the woman. "But you can
give<br>
me your long black hair; you know yourself that it is fine, and that<br>
I like! You shall have my white hair instead, and that's always<br>
something!"<br>
<br>
"Do you demand nothing else?" said she. "That I will gladly give
you!"<br>
And she gave her her fine black hair, and got the old woman's snow-white<br>
hair instead.<br>
<br>
So they went into Death's great greenhouse, where flowers and trees<br>
grew strangely into one another. There stood fine hyacinths under glass<br>
bells, and there stood strong-stemmed peonies; there grew water plants,<br>
some so fresh, others half sick, the water-snakes lay down on them,<br>
and black crabs pinched their stalks. There stood beautiful palm-trees,<br>
oaks, and plantains; there stood parsley and flowering thyme: every tree<br>
and every flower had its name; each of them was a human life, the human<br>
frame still lived--one in China, and another in Greenland--round about<br>
in the world. There were large trees in small pots, so that they stood<br>
so stunted in growth, and ready to burst the pots; in other places,<br>
there was a little dull flower in rich mould, with moss round about it,<br>
and it was so petted and nursed. But the distressed mother bent down<br>
over all the smallest plants, and heard within them how the human heart<br>
beat; and amongst millions she knew her child's.<br>
<br>
"There it is!" cried she, and stretched her hands out over a little
blue<br>
crocus, that hung quite sickly on one side.<br>
<br>
"Don't touch the flower!" said the old woman. "But place
yourself here,<br>
and when Death comes--I expect him every moment--do not let him pluck<br>
the flower up, but threaten him that you will do the same with the<br>
others. Then he will be afraid! He is responsible for them to OUR LORD,<br>
and no one dares to pluck them up before HE gives leave."<br>
<br>
All at once an icy cold rushed through the great hall, and the blind<br>
mother could feel that it was Death that came.<br>
<br>
"How hast thou been able to find thy way hither?" he asked. "How
couldst<br>
thou come quicker than I?"<br>
<br>
"I am a mother," said she.<br>
<br>
And Death stretched out his long hand towards the fine little flower,<br>
but she held her hands fast around his, so tight, and yet afraid that<br>
she should touch one of the leaves. Then Death blew on her hands, and<br>
she felt that it was colder than the cold wind, and her hands fell down<br>
powerless.<br>
<br>
"Thou canst not do anything against me!" said Death.<br>
<br>
"But OUR LORD can!" said she.<br>
<br>
"I only do His bidding!" said Death. "I am His gardener, I take
all His<br>
flowers and trees, and plant them out in the great garden of Paradise,<br>
in the unknown land; but how they grow there, and how it is there I dare<br>
not tell thee."<br>
<br>
"Give me back my child!" said the mother, and she wept and prayed. At<br>
once she seized hold of two beautiful flowers close by, with each hand,<br>
and cried out to Death, "I will tear all thy flowers off, for I am in<br>
despair."<br>
<br>
"Touch them not!" said Death. "Thou say'st that thou art so
unhappy, and<br>
now thou wilt make another mother equally unhappy."<br>
<br>
"Another mother!" said the poor woman, and directly let go her hold
of<br>
both the flowers.<br>
<br>
"There, thou hast thine eyes," said Death; "I fished them up
from the<br>
lake, they shone so bright; I knew not they were thine. Take them again,<br>
they are now brighter than before; now look down into the deep well<br>
close by; I shall tell thee the names of the two flowers thou wouldst<br>
have torn up, and thou wilt see their whole future life--their whole<br>
human existence: and see what thou wast about to disturb and destroy."<br>
<br>
And she looked down into the well; and it was a happiness to see how the<br>
one became a blessing to the world, to see how much happiness and joy<br>
were felt everywhere. And she saw the other's life, and it was sorrow<br>
and distress, horror, and wretchedness.<br>
<br>
"Both of them are God's will!" said Death.<br>
<br>
"Which of them is Misfortune's flower and which is that of
Happiness?"<br>
asked she.<br>
<br>
"That I will not tell thee," said Death; "but this thou shalt
know from<br>
me, that the one flower was thy own child! it was thy child's fate thou<br>
saw'st--thy own child's future life!"<br>
<br>
Then the mother screamed with terror, "Which of them was my child? Tell<br>
it me! Save the innocent! Save my child from all that misery! Rather<br>
take it away! Take it into God's kingdom! Forget my tears, forget my<br>
prayers, and all that I have done!"<br>
<br>
"I do not understand thee!" said Death. "Wilt thou have thy
child again,<br>
or shall I go with it there, where thou dost not know!"<br>
<br>
Then the mother wrung her hands, fell on her knees, and prayed to our<br>
Lord: "Oh, hear me not when I pray against Thy will, which is the best!<br>
hear me not! hear me not!"<br>
<br>
And she bowed her head down in her lap, and Death took her child and<br>
went with it into the unknown land.<br>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>THE FALSE COLLAR</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
There was once a fine gentleman, all of whose moveables were a boot-jack<br>
and a hair-comb: but he had the finest false collars in the world; and<br>
it is about one of these collars that we are now to hear a story.<br>
<br>
It was so old, that it began to think of marriage; and it happened that<br>
it came to be washed in company with a garter.<br>
<br>
"Nay!" said the collar. "I never did see anything so slender and
so<br>
fine, so soft and so neat. May I not ask your name?"<br>
<br>
"That I shall not tell you!" said the garter.<br>
<br>
"Where do you live?" asked the collar.<br>
<br>
But the garter was so bashful, so modest, and thought it was a strange<br>
question to answer.<br>
<br>
"You are certainly a girdle," said the collar; "that is to say
an inside<br>
girdle. I see well that you are both for use and ornament, my dear young<br>
lady."<br>
<br>
"I will thank you not to speak to me," said the garter. "I think
I have<br>
not given the least occasion for it."<br>
<br>
"Yes! When one is as handsome as you," said the collar, "that is<br>
occasion enough."<br>
<br>
"Don't come so near me, I beg of you!" said the garter. "You
look so<br>
much like those men-folks."<br>
<br>
"I am also a fine gentleman," said the collar. "I have a
bootjack and a<br>
hair-comb."<br>
<br>
But that was not true, for it was his master who had them: but he<br>
boasted.<br>
<br>
"Don't come so near me," said the garter: "I am not accustomed
to it."<br>
<br>
"Prude!" exclaimed the collar; and then it was taken out of the<br>
washing-tub. It was starched, hung over the back of a chair in the<br>
sunshine, and was then laid on the ironing-blanket; then came the warm<br>
box-iron. "Dear lady!" said the collar. "Dear widow-lady! I feel
quite<br>
hot. I am quite changed. I begin to unfold myself. You will burn a hole<br>
in me. Oh! I offer you my hand."<br>
<br>
"Rag!" said the box-iron; and went proudly over the collar: for she<br>
fancied she was a steam-engine, that would go on the railroad and draw<br>
the waggons. "Rag!" said the box-iron.<br>
<br>
The collar was a little jagged at the edge, and so came the long<br>
scissors to cut off the jagged part. "Oh!" said the collar. "You
are<br>
certainly the first opera dancer. How well you can stretch your legs<br>
out! It is the most graceful performance I have ever seen. No one can<br>
imitate you."<br>
<br>
"I know it," said the scissors.<br>
<br>
"You deserve to be a baroness," said the collar. "All that I
have is a<br>
fine gentleman, a boot-jack, and a hair-comb. If I only had the barony!"<br>
<br>
"Do you seek my hand?" said the scissors; for she was angry; and
without<br>
more ado, she CUT HIM, and then he was condemned.<br>
<br>
"I shall now be obliged to ask the hair-comb. It is surprising how well<br>
you preserve your teeth, Miss," said the collar. "Have you never
thought<br>
of being betrothed?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, of course! you may be sure of that," said the hair-comb.
"I AM<br>
betrothed--to the boot-jack!"<br>
<br>
"Betrothed!" exclaimed the collar. Now there was no other to court,
and<br>
so he despised it.<br>
<br>
A long time passed away, then the collar came into the rag chest at the<br>
paper mill; there was a large company of rags, the fine by themselves,<br>
and the coarse by themselves, just as it should be. They all had much to<br>
say, but the collar the most; for he was a real boaster.<br>
<br>
"I have had such an immense number of sweethearts!" said the collar.<br>
"I could not be in peace! It is true, I was always a fine starched-up<br>
gentleman! I had both a boot-jack and a hair-comb, which I never used!<br>
You should have seen me then, you should have seen me when I lay down!<br>
I shall never forget MY FIRST LOVE--she was a girdle, so fine, so soft,<br>
and so charming, she threw herself into a tub of water for my sake!<br>
There was also a widow, who became glowing hot, but I left her standing<br>
till she got black again; there was also the first opera dancer, she<br>
gave me that cut which I now go with, she was so ferocious! My<br>
own hair-comb was in love with me, she lost all her teeth from the<br>
heart-ache; yes, I have lived to see much of that sort of thing; but I<br>
am extremely sorry for the garter--I mean the girdle--that went into the<br>
water-tub. I have much on my conscience, I want to become white paper!"<br>
<br>
And it became so, all the rags were turned into white paper; but the<br>
collar came to be just this very piece of white paper we here see,<br>
and on which the story is printed; and that was because it boasted so<br>
terribly afterwards of what had never happened to it. It would be well<br>
for us to beware, that we may not act in a similar manner, for we can<br>
never know if we may not, in the course of time, also come into the<br>
rag chest, and be made into white paper, and then have our whole life's<br>
history printed on it, even the most secret, and be obliged to run about<br>
and tell it ourselves, just like this collar.<br>

        <p>1. The fine gentleman's moveables were a boot-jack and a hair-comb. He boasted about having the finest false collars in the world.</p>
        <p>2. The collar ended up in the rag chest because it boasted about experiences and relationships that had never happened to it. It now wishes to become white paper and hopes to be free of the false stories it told.</p>
        <p>3. The other characters mentioned include a garter, a box-iron, scissors, and a hair-comb. The garter and the collar engage in a conversation where the collar flirts with the garter. The scissors is angered by the collar's comments and cuts it. The hair-comb is betrothed to the boot-jack. The collar later expresses regret for the stories it told about its supposed romantic encounters.</p>
