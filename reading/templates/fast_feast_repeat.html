        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p>In a world saturated with diets, food rules, and willpower-driven restrictions, <em>Fast. Feast. Repeat.</em> offers a refreshing approach: <strong>intermittent fasting isn’t about what you eat—it’s about when.</strong> Written by teacher-turned-health-coach <strong>Gin Stephens</strong>, this book makes the science and practice of intermittent fasting (IF) accessible, flexible, and empowering.</p>
        <p>Published in 2020, <em>Fast. Feast. Repeat.</em> blends personal experience, community anecdotes, and research to promote <strong>a sustainable lifestyle</strong> rather than a crash diet. It’s particularly popular among women seeking weight loss, metabolic health, and food freedom—without counting calories.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Summary</strong></p>
        <p>The book is structured into three key sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fast:</strong> Introduces the science and history of IF, insulin regulation, autophagy, and metabolic flexibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Feast:</strong> Promotes mindful, satisfying eating with food freedom rather than restriction.</li>
            <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Helps readers create sustainable routines with methods like 16:8, 18:6, OMAD, and alternate day fasting.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Stephens guides readers through customization, plateaus, social settings, and long-term mindset shifts.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Core Concept</strong></p>
        <p>The core message of <em>Fast. Feast. Repeat.</em> is: <strong>Intermittent fasting isn’t a diet—it’s a sustainable rhythm that aligns with your body’s natural systems.</strong></p>
        <p>It helps lower insulin, trigger fat burning, and support cellular repair, all without obsessing over food or numbers.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Key Insights and Strategies</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clean fasting is essential:</strong> Only plain water, black coffee, unflavored tea, and mineral water during the fast.</li>
            <li><strong>Fasting lowers insulin:</strong> Allowing the body to tap into fat stores for energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Adaptation takes time:</strong> The first 28 days are for adjusting your metabolism and hunger hormones.</li>
            <li><strong>Eating windows bring freedom:</strong> Ditch calorie counting and eat until naturally satisfied.</li>
            <li><strong>Autophagy repairs cells:</strong> Longer fasts activate cellular cleanup for longevity and detoxification.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Quotes to Remember</strong></p>
        <blockquote>“Fasting is not about starving yourself. It’s about tapping into your body’s natural ability to thrive.”</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“Hunger is not an emergency.”</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“Fast clean. Feast deliciously. Repeat forever.”</blockquote>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Practical Application</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Start with 16:8:</strong> Fast for 16 hours, eat within an 8-hour window. Adjust as needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Drink water often:</strong> Stay hydrated and support detox and appetite regulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid artificial sweeteners:</strong> They can spike insulin and increase hunger even without calories.</li>
            <li><strong>Eat until satisfied:</strong> Focus on nutrient-dense foods without obsessing over macros or calories.</li>
            <li><strong>Track non-scale victories:</strong> Notice improvements in energy, mood, skin, digestion, and sleep.</li>
        </ul>
