        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p><em>Genius Foods</em>, by health journalist <strong>Max Lugavere</strong> (with Dr. Paul Grewal), explores the relationship between nutrition and brain health. Published in 2018, the book blends personal experience with scientific research to show how diet affects cognition, memory, mood, and long-term brain function. Motivated by his mother’s early-onset dementia, Lugavere lays out a roadmap to prevent cognitive decline through food and lifestyle choices.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Summary</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Genius foods:</strong> Avocados, olive oil, leafy greens, wild fatty fish, eggs, blueberries, and dark chocolate.</li>
            <li><strong>Foods to avoid:</strong> Refined sugars, processed seed oils, trans fats, ultra-processed carbs, and excess alcohol.</li>
            <li><strong>Supporting the brain:</strong> Focuses on fat for brain structure, stable blood sugar for focus, and gut health for mood and cognition.</li>
            <li><strong>Additional factors:</strong> Explores insulin resistance (aka "type 3 diabetes") and the gut-brain axis.</li>
            <li><strong>Includes:</strong> Dietary guidelines, grocery tips, and lifestyle strategies like sleep and exercise.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Core Concept</strong></p>
        <p>The core message of <em>Genius Foods</em> is: <strong>Your brain is shaped daily by what you eat. Choosing the right foods can enhance cognitive function, mood, and protect against neurodegeneration.</strong></p>
        <p>Eating smart isn’t just about your body—it’s about your future brain health too.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Key Insights and Strategies</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The brain thrives on fat:</strong> Especially omega-3s and monounsaturated fats for brain cell structure and communication.</li>
            <li><strong>Stable blood sugar = stable brain:</strong> Low-glycemic foods improve mood, memory, and concentration.</li>
            <li><strong>Insulin resistance harms cognition:</strong> Chronically high blood sugar and insulin are linked to Alzheimer’s risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Gut-brain connection:</strong> Microbiome health directly influences mood, focus, and inflammation.</li>
            <li><strong>Neuroplasticity and diet:</strong> You can grow new brain cells and improve function at any age with the right lifestyle.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Quotes to Remember</strong></p>
        <blockquote>“Food is information. Every bite you take speaks to your genes and your brain.”</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“Alzheimer’s disease begins in the brain decades before symptoms arise. Prevention starts now.”</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“Eat like your brain depends on it—because it does.”</blockquote>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Practical Application</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eat genius foods daily:</strong> Olive oil, avocado, eggs, greens, berries, wild fish, and dark chocolate.</li>
            <li><strong>Remove inflammatory foods:</strong> Cut sugar, processed grains, and industrial seed oils.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice intermittent fasting:</strong> Fasting can support mitochondrial health and reduce brain inflammation.</li>
            <li><strong>Move often:</strong> Exercise boosts BDNF, supporting learning and memory.</li>
            <li><strong>Sleep deeply:</strong> Deep sleep helps clear beta-amyloid, a protein linked to Alzheimer’s.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Interesting Facts and Stories</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inspired by his mother:</strong> Her dementia diagnosis led Max to investigate the connection between food and brain health.</li>
            <li><strong>Alzheimer’s is largely preventable:</strong> 90% of cases may be influenced by lifestyle rather than genetics.</li>
            <li><strong>The brain is energy-intensive:</strong> It uses up to 25% of the body’s energy and demands nutrient-rich fuel.</li>
            <li><strong>Olive oil is neuroprotective:</strong> It supports memory and reduces brain inflammation.</li>
            <li><strong>Brain fog is a red flag:</strong> It can signal insulin resistance, inflammation, or nutrient deficiencies.</li>
        </ul>
