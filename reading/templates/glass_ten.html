    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
      <p>'I won't be introduced to the pudding, please,' Alice said rather
hastily, 'or we shall get no dinner at all. May I give you some?'</p>
<p>But the Red Queen looked sulky, and growled 'Pudding--Alice;
Alice--Pudding. Remove the pudding!' and the waiters took it away so
quickly that Alice couldn't return its bow.</p>
<p>However, she didn't see why the Red Queen should be the only one to give
orders, so, as an experiment, she called out 'Waiter! Bring back the
pudding!' and there it was again in a moment like a conjuring-trick. It
was so large that she couldn't help feeling a LITTLE shy with it, as she
had been with the mutton; however, she conquered her shyness by a great
effort and cut a slice and handed it to the Red Queen.</p>
<p>'What impertinence!' said the Pudding. 'I wonder how you'd like it, if I
were to cut a slice out of YOU, you creature!'</p>
<p>It spoke in a thick, suety sort of voice, and Alice hadn't a word to say
in reply: she could only sit and look at it and gasp.</p>
<p>'Make a remark,' said the Red Queen: 'it's ridiculous to leave all the
conversation to the pudding!'</p>
<p>'Do you know, I've had such a quantity of poetry repeated to me to-day,' Alice began, a little frightened at finding that, the moment she opened her lips, there was dead silence, and all eyes were fixed upon her; 'and
it's a very curious thing, I think--every poem was about fishes in some
way. Do you know why they're so fond of fishes, all about here?'</p>
<p>She spoke to the Red Queen, whose answer was a little wide of the mark.
'As to fishes,' she said, very slowly and solemnly, putting her mouth
close to Alice's ear, 'her White Majesty knows a lovely riddle--all in
poetry--all about fishes. Shall she repeat it?'</p>
<p>'Her Red Majesty's very kind to mention it,' the White Queen murmured
into Alice's other ear, in a voice like the cooing of a pigeon. 'It
would be SUCH a treat! May I?'</p>
<p>'Please do,' Alice said very politely.</p>
<p>The White Queen laughed with delight, and stroked Alice's cheek. Then
she began:</p>
        <p style="text-align:center">"First, the fish must be caught."</p>
<p style="text-align:center">That is easy: a baby, I think, could have caught it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">"Next, the fish must be bought."</p>
<p style="text-align:center">That is easy: a penny, I think, would have bought it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">"Now cook me the fish!"</p>
<p style="text-align:center">That is easy, and will not take more than a minute.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">"Let it lie in a dish!"</p>
<p style="text-align:center">That is easy, because it already is in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">"Bring it here! Let me sup!"</p>
<p style="text-align:center">It is easy to set such a dish on the table.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">"Take the dish-cover up!"</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Ah, THAT is so hard that I fear I'm unable!</p>
<p style="text-align:center">For it holds it like glue--</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Holds the lid to the dish, while it lies in the middle:</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Which is easiest to do,</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Un-dish-cover the fish, or dishcover the riddle?'</p>
        <p>'Meanwhile, we'll drink your health--Queen Alice's health!' she screamed
at the top of her voice, and all the guests began drinking it directly,
and very queerly they managed it: some of them put their glasses upon
their heads like extinguishers, and drank all that trickled down their
faces--others upset the decanters, and drank the wine as it ran off
the edges of the table--and three of them (who looked like kangaroos)
scrambled into the dish of roast mutton, and began eagerly lapping up
the gravy, 'just like pigs in a trough!' thought Alice.</p>
<p>'You ought to return thanks in a neat speech,' the Red Queen said,
frowning at Alice as she spoke.</p>
<p>'We must support you, you know,' the White Queen whispered, as Alice got
up to do it, very obediently, but a little frightened.</p>
<p>'Thank you very much,' she whispered in reply, 'but I can do quite well
without.'</p>
<p>'That wouldn't be at all the thing,' the Red Queen said very decidedly:
so Alice tried to submit to it with a good grace.</p>
<p>('And they DID push so!' she said afterwards, when she was telling her
sister the history of the feast. 'You would have thought they wanted to
squeeze me flat!')</p>
<p>In fact it was rather difficult for her to keep in her place while she
made her speech: the two Queens pushed her so, one on each side, that
they nearly lifted her up into the air: 'I rise to return thanks--'
Alice began: and she really DID rise as she spoke, several inches; but
she got hold of the edge of the table, and managed to pull herself down
again.</p>
<p>'Take care of yourself!' screamed the White Queen, seizing Alice's hair
with both her hands. 'Something's going to happen!'</p>
<p>And then (as Alice afterwards described it) all sorts of things happened
in a moment. The candles all grew up to the ceiling, looking something
like a bed of rushes with fireworks at the top. As to the bottles, they
each took a pair of plates, which they hastily fitted on as wings, and
so, with forks for legs, went fluttering about in all directions: 'and
very like birds they look,' Alice thought to herself, as well as she
could in the dreadful confusion that was beginning.</p>
        <p>At this moment she heard a hoarse laugh at her side, and turned to see
what was the matter with the White Queen; but, instead of the Queen,
there was the leg of mutton sitting in the chair. 'Here I am!' cried a
voice from the soup tureen, and Alice turned again, just in time to see
the Queen's broad good-natured face grinning at her for a moment over
the edge of the tureen, before she disappeared into the soup.</p>
<p>There was not a moment to be lost. Already several of the guests were
lying down in the dishes, and the soup ladle was walking up the table
towards Alice's chair, and beckoning to her impatiently to get out of
its way.</p>
<p>'I can't stand this any longer!' she cried as she jumped up and seized
the table-cloth with both hands: one good pull, and plates, dishes,
guests, and candles came crashing down together in a heap on the floor.</p>
<p>'And as for YOU,' she went on, turning fiercely upon the Red Queen, whom
she considered as the cause of all the mischief--but the Queen was no
longer at her side--she had suddenly dwindled down to the size of a
little doll, and was now on the table, merrily running round and round
after her own shawl, which was trailing behind her.</p>
<p>At any other time, Alice would have felt surprised at this, but she was
far too much excited to be surprised at anything NOW. 'As for YOU,'
she repeated, catching hold of the little creature in the very act of
jumping over a bottle which had just lighted upon the table, 'I'll shake
you into a kitten, that I will!'</p>
<p>CHAPTER X. Shaking</p>
<p>She took her off the table as she spoke, and shook her backwards and
forwards with all her might.</p>
<p>The Red Queen made no resistance whatever; only her face grew very
small, and her eyes got large and green: and still, as Alice went on
shaking her, she kept on growing shorter--and fatter--and softer--and
rounder--and--</p>
<p>CHAPTER XI. Waking</p>
<p>--and it really WAS a kitten, after all.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XII. Which Dreamed it?</p>
        <p>'Your majesty shouldn't purr so loud,' Alice said, rubbing her eyes, and addressing the kitten, respectfully, yet with some severity. 'You woke me out of oh! such a nice dream! And you've been along with me, Kitty--all through the Looking-Glass world. Did you know it, dear?'</p>
<p>It is a very inconvenient habit of kittens (Alice had once made the remark) that, whatever you say to them, they ALWAYS purr. 'If they would only purr for "yes" and mew for "no," or any rule of that sort,' she had said, 'so that one could keep up a conversation! But how CAN you talk with a person if they always say the same thing?'</p>
<p>On this occasion the kitten only purred: and it was impossible to guess whether it meant 'yes' or 'no.'</p>
<p>So Alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had found the Red Queen: then she went down on her knees on the hearth-rug, and put the kitten and the Queen to look at each other. 'Now, Kitty!' she cried, clapping her hands triumphantly. 'Confess that was what you turned into!'</p>
<p>('But it wouldn't look at it,' she said, when she was explaining the thing afterwards to her sister: 'it turned away its head, and pretended not to see it: but it looked a LITTLE ashamed of itself, so I think it MUST have been the Red Queen.')</p>
<p>'Sit up a little more stiffly, dear!' Alice cried with a merry laugh. 'And curtsey while you're thinking what to--what to purr. It saves time, remember!' And she caught it up and gave it one little kiss, 'just in honour of having been a Red Queen.'</p>
<p>'Snowdrop, my pet!' she went on, looking over her shoulder at the White Kitten, which was still patiently undergoing its toilet, 'when WILL Dinah have finished with your White Majesty, I wonder? That must be the reason you were so untidy in my dream--Dinah! do you know that you're scrubbing a White Queen? Really, it's most disrespectful of you!</p>
<p>'And what did DINAH turn to, I wonder?' she prattled on, as she settled comfortably down, with one elbow in the rug, and her chin in her hand, to watch the kittens. 'Tell me, Dinah, did you turn to Humpty Dumpty? I THINK you did--however, you'd better not mention it to your friends just yet, for I'm not sure.</p>
<p>'By the way, Kitty, if only you'd been really with me in my dream, there was one thing you WOULD have enjoyed--I had such a quantity of poetry said to me, all about fishes! To-morrow morning you shall have a real treat. All the time you're eating your breakfast, I'll repeat "The Walrus and the Carpenter" to you; and then you can make believe it's oysters, dear!</p>
<p>'Now, Kitty, let's consider who it was that dreamed it all. This is a
serious question, my dear, and you should NOT go on licking your paw
like that--as if Dinah hadn't washed you this morning! You see, Kitty,
it MUST have been either me or the Red King. He was part of my dream,
of course--but then I was part of his dream, too! WAS it the Red King,
Kitty? You were his wife, my dear, so you ought to know--Oh, Kitty, DO
help to settle it! I'm sure your paw can wait!' But the provoking kitten
only began on the other paw, and pretended it hadn't heard the question.
</p>
        <p>Which do YOU think it was?</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">A boat beneath a sunny sky,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Lingering onward dreamily</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In an evening of July--</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Children three that nestle near,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Eager eye and willing ear,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Pleased a simple tale to hear--</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Long has paled that sunny sky:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Echoes fade and memories die.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Autumn frosts have slain July.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Still she haunts me, phantomwise,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Alice moving under skies</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Never seen by waking eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Children yet, the tale to hear,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Eager eye and willing ear,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Lovingly shall nestle near.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In a Wonderland they lie,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Dreaming as the days go by,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Dreaming as the summers die:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Ever drifting down the stream--</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Lingering in the golden gleam--</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Life, what is it but a dream?</p>

        <p>1. Alice asked not to be introduced to the pudding because she was afraid that it might not behave nicely or might not like her. She thought it was safer to keep a distance from it.</p>
        <p>2. The theme Alice noticed in the poetries she heard from the Red Queen was all about a battle or a fight.</p>
        <p>3. The guests were drinking from cups made of different materials such as gold, silver, glass, and even hair.</p>
        <p>4. During the party, chaos broke out as the animals started fighting and throwing things at each other. When Alice was about to give her speech, the animals interrupted her by demanding she recite a poem.</p>
        <p>5. The Red Queen turned into a kitten in Alice's dream.</p>
        <p>6. The story was definitely not a normal dream. It was a crazy and surreal dream full of absurdities, illogical events, and characters that defy the laws of physics and common sense.</p>
        <p>7. The Cheshire Cat turned into the White Queen in Alice's dream.</p>
        <p>8. Dinah is Alice's cat in the real world, and in the dream, she is Alice's pet cat that she talks to and confides in.</p>
        <p>9. The reason why all the poems in the dream were about fish is that Alice fell asleep while reading a book about fishing, and her subconscious mind incorporated that theme into her dream.</p>
        <p>10. The author, Lewis Carroll, ends the book with a poem to emphasize the dreamlike quality of the story and to leave the reader with a sense of wonder and imagination. The poem suggests that life itself is a fleeting dream and that we should enjoy it while it lasts.</p>
