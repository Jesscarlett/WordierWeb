        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p><em>How to Be Well</em> by functional medicine pioneer <strong>Dr. Frank Lipman</strong> is a holistic, actionable guide to building sustainable health across six essential areas: Eat, Sleep, Move, Protect, Unwind, and Connect. Published in 2018, the book blends science, ancestral wisdom, and decades of clinical experience to create a comprehensive wellness manual focused on prevention and daily vitality.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Summary</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eat:</strong> Focus on real, whole food—vegetables, clean proteins, healthy fats, and fermented foods. Avoid processed items, sugar, and vegetable oils.</li>
            <li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Prioritize high-quality rest through good sleep hygiene, limiting blue light, and maintaining a calming bedtime routine.</li>
            <li><strong>Move:</strong> Incorporate daily movement—walking, strength training, stretching—and reduce sedentary time.</li>
            <li><strong>Protect:</strong> Reduce toxic exposure by eliminating plastics, pesticides, and artificial chemicals from your environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Unwind:</strong> Manage stress through breathwork, meditation, nature, and setting boundaries.</li>
            <li><strong>Connect:</strong> Strengthen relationships and social ties for better emotional and physical health.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Core Concept</strong></p>
        <p>The core message of <em>How to Be Well</em> is: <strong>Health isn’t a destination or diagnosis—it’s a lifestyle of consistent choices across physical, emotional, and environmental domains.</strong></p>
        <p>Daily practices—not perfection—lead to long-term wellbeing and resilience.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Key Insights and Strategies</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Food is medicine:</strong> Nutrient-dense, whole foods support the gut, immune system, and mood.</li>
            <li><strong>Sleep is non-negotiable:</strong> It repairs the body, balances hormones, and boosts cognition.</li>
            <li><strong>Movement is natural:</strong> Regular, gentle activity prevents stagnation and boosts metabolism.</li>
            <li><strong>Detox your home:</strong> Use clean air, water, and products to avoid chronic toxic exposure.</li>
            <li><strong>Stress management is essential:</strong> Chronic stress ages the body and shrinks the brain—recovery matters.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Quotes to Remember</strong></p>
        <blockquote>“Health isn’t the absence of disease—it’s the presence of vitality.”</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“Every small habit is a vote for or against your future health.”</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“Wellness is not about willpower. It’s about environment, education, and support.”</blockquote>
