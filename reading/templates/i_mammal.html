        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p><em>I, Mammal: The Story of What Makes Us Mammals</em> by Liam Drew, published in 2017, is an engaging exploration of what it really means to be a mammal.</p>
        <p>Drew, a neurobiologist turned science writer, blends biology, evolution, and personal reflection to uncover the unique features that define mammalian life and connect humans to other mammals.</p>
        <p>This is a story about our biological identity and our shared mammalian heritage.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>What Makes a Mammal?</strong></p>
        <p>Mammals are defined by a combination of unique traits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Warm-bloodedness:</strong> The ability to regulate internal temperature.</li>
            <li><strong>Fur or hair:</strong> Present in all mammals at some life stage.</li>
            <li><strong>Three middle ear bones:</strong> Essential for sensitive hearing.</li>
            <li><strong>Milk production:</strong> Mammary glands that nourish young.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Drew emphasizes that each of these features has a deep evolutionary story.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>The Invention of Milk</strong></p>
        <p>Milk is the defining trait of mammals. Drew traces its origins to skin secretions in ancient ancestors and shows how milk evolved to provide nourishment and survival advantages to young mammals.</p>
        <p>Milk allowed mammals to invest in their offspring in ways that set them apart from other animals.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Fur, Warmth, and Touch</strong></p>
        <p>Fur evolved to help mammals maintain stable body temperatures, enabling them to thrive in diverse environments.</p>
        <p>Drew also highlights the sensory and social functions of fur, including grooming and touch-based bonding.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Middle Ear Bones: A Mammalian Superpower</strong></p>
        <p>Mammals have three middle ear bones that enable highly sensitive hearing, especially at high frequencies.</p>
        <p>These bones evolved from parts of the jaw in reptilian ancestors, providing mammals with a distinct sensory advantage.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>The Rise of the Brain</strong></p>
        <p>Mammalian brains, especially the neocortex, are known for flexibility, intelligence, and emotional depth.</p>
        <p>Drew explains how mammalian brains evolved to support complex social lives, problem-solving, and caregiving behaviors.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Parenting and Attachment</strong></p>
        <p>Parental care is central to mammalian reproduction. Mammals invest heavily in their young, forming close bonds through pregnancy, nursing, and caregiving.</p>
        <p>Drew shares personal parenting experiences, adding an emotional layer to the biological science.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Shared Mammalian Heritage</strong></p>
        <p>Drew emphasizes that humans are mammals, deeply connected to other species by shared traits, biology, and evolutionary history.</p>
        <p>He encourages readers to see animals as kin, not as separate from us.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Evolutionary Surprises: Egg-Laying Mammals</strong></p>
        <p>Drew explores the unique world of monotremes like the platypus and echidna—egg-laying mammals that defy expectations and showcase nature’s diversity.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Key Takeaways and Insights</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mammals are defined by warm-bloodedness, fur, milk production, three middle ear bones, and complex brains.</li>
            <li>Milk and parental care are at the heart of mammalian success.</li>
            <li>Fur provides warmth, sensory function, and social connection.</li>
            <li>Unique ear bones give mammals a superior sense of hearing.</li>
            <li>The mammalian brain enables intelligence, flexibility, and emotional depth.</li>
            <li>Parental care and attachment are widespread across mammalian species.</li>
            <li>Humans are mammals—part of a vast, interconnected evolutionary story.</li>
            <li>Mammalian diversity, from rodents to monotremes, highlights evolution’s creativity.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Why This Book Matters</strong></p>
        <p><em>I, Mammal</em> is a powerful reminder of the traits that unite us with the animal world. Liam Drew masterfully combines science and storytelling to help us understand our place in nature.</p>
        <p>The book encourages empathy, curiosity, and a deeper appreciation for our shared biological heritage.</p>
        <p>It’s a celebration of life as a mammal—and a call to see animals not as distant creatures, but as family.</p>
