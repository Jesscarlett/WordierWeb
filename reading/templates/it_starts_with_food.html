        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p>Before <em>The Whole30</em> became a movement, there was <em>It Starts With Food</em>—the foundational book where certified sports nutritionists <strong>Dallas and Melissa Hartwig</strong> introduced their science-backed elimination and reintroduction program to the world. Published in 2012, this book is more than a diet guide—it’s a deep dive into how food affects <strong>your hormones, metabolism, brain, gut, immune system, and long-term health</strong>.</p>
        <p>With a no-nonsense tone and actionable steps, the Hartwigs explain how eliminating certain foods for 30 days can radically transform your health, habits, and mindset.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Summary</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Four Goals of Food:</strong> Support healthy psychological and hormonal responses, a healthy gut, and reduce inflammation.</li>
            <li><strong>Foods to eliminate:</strong> Sugar, grains, legumes, dairy, alcohol, and all processed items.</li>
            <li><strong>Foods to eat:</strong> Animal protein, vegetables, fruits, healthy fats, herbs, and spices.</li>
            <li><strong>After 30 days:</strong> Gradually reintroduce eliminated foods to see how they affect your health and mood.</li>
            <li><strong>Biological & psychological effects:</strong> The book explains how hyperpalatable foods impact hormones, cravings, and behavior.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Core Concept</strong></p>
        <p>The core message of <em>It Starts With Food</em> is: <strong>Food is the foundation of health, and by changing what you eat for 30 days, you can change everything—from digestion and cravings to inflammation, mood, and energy.</strong></p>
        <p>Eliminating harmful foods and replacing them with healing whole foods gives the body a much-needed reset.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Key Insights and Strategies</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Modern foods override biology:</strong> Highly processed combos of fat, sugar, and salt hijack the brain’s reward system.</li>
            <li><strong>Gut health drives whole-body health:</strong> Grains and dairy can cause inflammation and leaky gut.</li>
            <li><strong>Control blood sugar swings:</strong> Stable insulin is key to energy and fat regulation.</li>
            <li><strong>The gut-brain axis is powerful:</strong> What you eat influences hormones, neurotransmitters, and behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Elimination is necessary:</strong> The only way to uncover food sensitivities is to remove and reintroduce them.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Quotes to Remember</strong></p>
        <blockquote>“The food you eat either makes you more healthy or less healthy. Those are your options.”</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“This is not hard. Don’t you dare tell us this is hard.”</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“You can’t just eat healthy once in a while and expect to be healthy.”</blockquote>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Practical Application</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Do the 30-day reset:</strong> Follow the Whole30-style elimination plan using only real, whole foods.</li>
            <li><strong>Skip the scale:</strong> Focus on non-scale victories like energy, sleep, and mood.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare in advance:</strong> Batch cook, plan meals, and stock compliant pantry staples.</li>
            <li><strong>Label reading is essential:</strong> Look out for hidden sugars, soy, and preservatives.</li>
            <li><strong>Reintroduce slowly:</strong> One food group at a time—observe how your body responds.</li>
        </ul>
