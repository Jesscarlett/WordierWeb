        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p>Is exercise enough to make us healthy? In <em>Move Your DNA</em>, biomechanist and movement educator <strong>Katy Bowman</strong> challenges conventional fitness thinking by arguing that <strong>it's not just how much you move, but <em>how</em> you move—and how often.</strong></p>
        <p>Published in 2014, this groundbreaking book proposes that modern diseases—like pelvic floor disorders, osteoporosis, and metabolic issues—aren’t caused by aging or lack of exercise, but by <em>a lack of diverse, natural movement.</em> Just like nutrition, movement is a biological input that shapes your health on a cellular level.</p>
        <p>Bowman’s message: Don’t just add exercise into your life. Restructure your life so movement is woven into every moment.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Summary</strong></p>
        <p>Bowman redefines what movement means, going beyond exercise to focus on <strong>natural, whole-body movement</strong> throughout the day. She draws a distinction between “movement” and “exercise,” emphasizing that even those who work out regularly may still be <em>sedentary</em> if they sit for most of the day.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Movement is like food:</strong> Just as you need a variety of nutrients, your body needs a variety of movements. Repetitive gym routines aren’t enough—our cells need different loads and ranges of motion.</li>
            <li><strong>Sedentary culture is systemic:</strong> Modern life (cars, couches, screens) limits how often and how diversely we move, leading to chronic issues in the feet, hips, spine, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>Micronutrient movements matter:</strong> Small, often-neglected movements like squatting, walking on uneven surfaces, or toe-spreading are crucial for full-body health.</li>
            <li><strong>Environment shapes movement:</strong> The spaces we live and work in affect how much and how well we move. Bowman advocates for minimal footwear, floor sitting, and active furniture.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment is key:</strong> Poor postural habits contribute to mechanical stress on the body. Restoring alignment and mobility can help relieve pain and dysfunction.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bowman combines scientific explanation with practical advice, including movement “prescriptions,” alignment tips, and step-by-step guidance to build a life rich in movement.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Core Concept</strong></p>
        <p>The central message of <em>Move Your DNA</em> is: <strong>Movement is a nutrient.</strong> Just like food, it affects us on a cellular level—and deficiencies in certain kinds of movement lead to predictable symptoms and breakdowns.</p>
        <p>Fitness doesn’t equal health if movement diversity is missing. To thrive, we need to move more and move better—not just at the gym, but all day long.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Key Insights and Strategies</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Exercise ≠ Movement:</strong> You can be an “active sedentary” person—someone who exercises for an hour but sits for the other 23. Health comes from continuous, varied movement throughout the day.</li>
            <li><strong>Movement Variety Prevents Wear and Tear:</strong> Repetitive motions overload specific tissues, while underusing others. Just like a varied diet, movement diversity supports balanced health.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment Affects Cellular Health:</strong> The way you hold and use your body affects circulation, nerve function, joint wear, and cellular repair.</li>
            <li><strong>Shoes Change Your Movement:</strong> Modern footwear restricts natural foot mechanics. Going barefoot or using minimal shoes helps restore balance, strength, and sensory input.</li>
            <li><strong>Movement Environment Matters:</strong> Swap chairs for floor cushions, walk on natural terrain, squat instead of sit—your home and workplace can support healthier movement habits.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Quotes to Remember</strong></p>
        <blockquote>“You can’t fix the problem of too little movement with just one hour at the gym.”</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“Movement is not just about burning calories—it’s about cellular communication.”</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“Every movement you make, or don’t make, is shaping your body.”</blockquote>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Practical Application</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stand and walk more:</strong> make walking your default mode of travel whenever possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Transition to minimal footwear:</strong> strengthen foot muscles and improve posture.</li>
            <li><strong>Change your sitting habits:</strong> sit on the floor, squat, or kneel to engage different muscles.</li>
            <li><strong>Add movement “snacks”:</strong> incorporate calf stretches, toe lifts, shoulder rolls, and squats throughout the day.</li>
            <li><strong>Rethink your furniture:</strong> use standing desks, floor cushions, or active seating that encourages posture shifts.</li>
            <li><strong>Make movement social and daily:</strong> walk with friends, play with kids, do chores mindfully and with intention.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Interesting Facts and Stories</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>You Can Be “Exercised” But Still Sedentary:</strong> Bowman uses the term “active sedentary” to describe people who work out daily but spend the rest of their time sitting—and explains why that’s not enough.</li>
            <li><strong>NASA’s Astronaut Studies Inspired Her Thinking:</strong> Research on muscle loss in space revealed that lack of gravity—and thus mechanical loading—quickly breaks down body tissues, mirroring effects of sedentary life on Earth.</li>
            <li><strong>Your Pelvic Floor Is a Movement Issue:</strong> Pelvic health problems, often seen as medical, are reframed as alignment and movement deficiencies related to posture, gait, and sitting habits.</li>
            <li><strong>She Lives What She Teaches:</strong> Bowman and her family live in a movement-rich environment—walking daily, wearing minimal shoes, squatting to rest, and integrating natural movement into everything from work to parenting.</li>
            <li><strong>Movement Impacts Every System:</strong> From circulation to digestion to cognition, Bowman connects diverse forms of movement to biological performance—highlighting how interwoven movement is with health.</li>
