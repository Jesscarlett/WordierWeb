        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p><em>Napoleon’s Buttons</em> explores how 17 groups of molecules have changed the world—from triggering wars and driving exploration to transforming medicine, industry, and social norms.</p>
        <p>Penny Le Couteur and Jay Burreson show how molecules—not just people—have been powerful agents in history.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>The Chemistry of History</strong></p>
        <p>Each chapter of the book focuses on one molecular group and its ripple effects across history. The authors demonstrate that molecules can influence the rise and fall of empires just as much as generals and kings.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Highlights from the 17 Molecules</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pepper, Nutmeg, Clove:</strong> Fueled the Age of Exploration and colonization.</li>
            <li><strong>Vitamin C:</strong> Solved scurvy and enabled long voyages.</li>
            <li><strong>Glucose:</strong> Helped create plantation economies and drove the slave trade.</li>
            <li><strong>Cellulose:</strong> Central to agriculture, textiles, and the Industrial Revolution.</li>
            <li><strong>Nitro compounds:</strong> Explosives that changed warfare and mining.</li>
            <li><strong>Silk & Nylon:</strong> Defined trade routes and modern materials.</li>
            <li><strong>Synthetic dyes:</strong> Birthed the modern pharmaceutical industry.</li>
            <li><strong>Penicillin and antibiotics:</strong> Revolutionized medicine.</li>
            <li><strong>The Pill:</strong> Transformed reproductive rights and gender roles.</li>
            <li><strong>Toxins:</strong> From assassinations to pharmaceuticals, toxins walk a fine line between death and cure.</li>
            <li><strong>Chlorocarbons:</strong> Industrial miracles that also harmed the ozone layer.</li>
            <li><strong>Aspirin:</strong> Ancient cure refined into a modern miracle drug.</li>
            <li><strong>Morphine & analgesics:</strong> Essential for pain management—and linked to addiction crises.</li>
            <li><strong>Steroids & Hormones:</strong> Influenced medicine, sports, and identity.</li>
            <li><strong>Polymers:</strong> Built the modern plastic world—for better and worse.</li>
            <li><strong>Tin:</strong> Possibly contributed to Napoleon’s defeat via degrading buttons in the Russian winter.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>The Power of Molecular Structure</strong></p>
        <p>The authors show how the tiniest changes in molecular structure can result in completely different effects—poison or cure, fiber or fuel, drug or hormone.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Why This Book Matters</strong></p>
        <p><em>Napoleon’s Buttons</em> proves that chemistry is not separate from history—it drives it.</p>
        <p>This book makes science accessible and reveals that molecules, quietly working in the background, have directed the fate of civilizations.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Key Takeaways and Insights</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Molecules have shaped global history—through food, trade, war, and medicine.</li>
            <li>Structure defines function: small changes at the atomic level have massive consequences.</li>
            <li>Chemistry powered the Age of Exploration, industrialization, and modern medicine.</li>
            <li>Synthetic molecules built new industries and revolutionized society.</li>
            <li>Understanding molecules helps us grasp not only the past but the choices we face for the future.</li>
        </ul>
