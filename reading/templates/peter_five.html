<br>
The more quickly this horror is disposed of the better. The first to<br>
emerge from his tree was Curly. He rose out of it into the arms of<br>
Cecco, who flung him to Smee, who flung him to Starkey, who flung him to<br>
Bill Jukes, who flung him to Noodler, and so he was tossed from one to<br>
another till he fell at the feet of the black pirate. All the boys were<br>
plucked from their trees in this ruthless manner; and several of them<br>
were in the air at a time, like bales of goods flung from hand to hand.<br>
<br>
A different treatment was accorded to Wendy, who came last. With<br>
ironical politeness Hook raised his hat to her, and, offering her his<br>
arm, escorted her to the spot where the others were being gagged. He<br>
did it with such an air, he was so frightfully DISTINGUE [imposingly<br>
distinguished], that she was too fascinated to cry out. She was only a<br>
little girl.<br>
<br>
Perhaps it is tell-tale to divulge that for a moment Hook entranced her,<br>
and we tell on her only because her slip led to strange results. Had she<br>
haughtily unhanded him (and we should have loved to write it of her),<br>
she would have been hurled through the air like the others, and then<br>
Hook would probably not have been present at the tying of the children;<br>
and had he not been at the tying he would not have discovered Slightly's<br>
secret, and without the secret he could not presently have made his foul<br>
attempt on Peter's life.<br>
<br>
They were tied to prevent their flying away, doubled up with their knees<br>
close to their ears; and for the trussing of them the black pirate had<br>
cut a rope into nine equal pieces. All went well until Slightly's turn<br>
came, when he was found to be like those irritating parcels that use up<br>
all the string in going round and leave no tags [ends] with which to<br>
tie a knot. The pirates kicked him in their rage, just as you kick the<br>
parcel (though in fairness you should kick the string); and strange<br>
to say it was Hook who told them to belay their violence. His lip was<br>
curled with malicious triumph. While his dogs were merely sweating<br>
because every time they tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in one<br>
part he bulged out in another, Hook's master mind had gone far beneath<br>
Slightly's surface, probing not for effects but for causes; and his<br>
exultation showed that he had found them. Slightly, white to the gills,<br>
knew that Hook had surprised [discovered] his secret, which was this,<br>
that no boy so blown out could use a tree wherein an average man need<br>
stick. Poor Slightly, most wretched of all the children now, for he<br>
was in a panic about Peter, bitterly regretted what he had done. Madly<br>
addicted to the drinking of water when he was hot, he had swelled in<br>
consequence to his present girth, and instead of reducing himself to fit<br>
his tree he had, unknown to the others, whittled his tree to make it fit<br>
him.<br>
<br>
Sufficient of this Hook guessed to persuade him that Peter at last lay<br>
at his mercy, but no word of the dark design that now formed in the<br>
subterranean caverns of his mind crossed his lips; he merely signed<br>
that the captives were to be conveyed to the ship, and that he would be<br>
alone.<br>
<br>
How to convey them? Hunched up in their ropes they might indeed be<br>
rolled down hill like barrels, but most of the way lay through a morass.<br>
Again Hook's genius surmounted difficulties. He indicated that the<br>
little house must be used as a conveyance. The children were flung into<br>
it, four stout pirates raised it on their shoulders, the others fell in<br>
behind, and singing the hateful pirate chorus the strange procession<br>
set off through the wood. I don't know whether any of the children were<br>
crying; if so, the singing drowned the sound; but as the little house<br>
disappeared in the forest, a brave though tiny jet of smoke issued from<br>
its chimney as if defying Hook.<br>
<br>
Hook saw it, and it did Peter a bad service. It dried up any trickle of<br>
pity for him that may have remained in the pirate's infuriated breast.<br>
<br>
The first thing he did on finding himself alone in the fast falling<br>
night was to tiptoe to Slightly's tree, and make sure that it provided<br>
him with a passage. Then for long he remained brooding; his hat of ill<br>
omen on the sward, so that any gentle breeze which had arisen might play<br>
refreshingly through his hair. Dark as were his thoughts his blue eyes<br>
were as soft as the periwinkle. Intently he listened for any sound from<br>
the nether world, but all was as silent below as above; the house under<br>
the ground seemed to be but one more empty tenement in the void. Was<br>
that boy asleep, or did he stand waiting at the foot of Slightly's tree,<br>
with his dagger in his hand?<br>
<br>
There was no way of knowing, save by going down. Hook let his cloak slip<br>
softly to the ground, and then biting his lips till a lewd blood stood<br>
on them, he stepped into the tree. He was a brave man, but for a moment<br>
he had to stop there and wipe his brow, which was dripping like a<br>
candle. Then, silently, he let himself go into the unknown.<br>
<br>
He arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft, and stood still again,<br>
biting at his breath, which had almost left him. As his eyes became<br>
accustomed to the dim light various objects in the home under the trees<br>
took shape; but the only one on which his greedy gaze rested, long<br>
sought for and found at last, was the great bed. On the bed lay Peter<br>
fast asleep.<br>
<br>
Unaware of the tragedy being enacted above, Peter had continued, for<br>
a little time after the children left, to play gaily on his pipes: no<br>
doubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not care.<br>
Then he decided not to take his medicine, so as to grieve Wendy. Then he<br>
lay down on the bed outside the coverlet, to vex her still more; for she<br>
had always tucked them inside it, because you never know that you may<br>
not grow chilly at the turn of the night. Then he nearly cried; but<br>
it struck him how indignant she would be if he laughed instead; so he<br>
laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the middle of it.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, though not often, he had dreams, and they were more painful<br>
than the dreams of other boys. For hours he could not be separated from<br>
these dreams, though he wailed piteously in them. They had to do, I<br>
think, with the riddle of his existence. At such times it had been<br>
Wendy's custom to take him out of bed and sit with him on her lap,<br>
soothing him in dear ways of her own invention, and when he grew calmer<br>
to put him back to bed before he quite woke up, so that he should<br>
not know of the indignity to which she had subjected him. But on this<br>
occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep. One arm dropped<br>
over the edge of the bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished part of<br>
his laugh was stranded on his mouth, which was open, showing the little<br>
pearls.<br>
<br>
Thus defenceless Hook found him. He stood silent at the foot of the tree<br>
looking across the chamber at his enemy. Did no feeling of compassion<br>
disturb his sombre breast? The man was not wholly evil; he loved flowers<br>
(I have been told) and sweet music (he was himself no mean performer on<br>
the harpsichord); and, let it be frankly admitted, the idyllic nature of<br>
the scene stirred him profoundly. Mastered by his better self he would<br>
have returned reluctantly up the tree, but for one thing.<br>
<br>
What stayed him was Peter's impertinent appearance as he slept. The<br>
open mouth, the drooping arm, the arched knee: they were such a<br>
personification of cockiness as, taken together, will never again, one<br>
may hope, be presented to eyes so sensitive to their offensiveness. They<br>
steeled Hook's heart. If his rage had broken him into a hundred pieces<br>
every one of them would have disregarded the incident, and leapt at the<br>
sleeper.<br>
<br>
Though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed, Hook stood in<br>
darkness himself, and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered<br>
an obstacle, the door of Slightly's tree. It did not entirely fill the<br>
aperture, and he had been looking over it. Feeling for the catch,<br>
he found to his fury that it was low down, beyond his reach. To his<br>
disordered brain it seemed then that the irritating quality in Peter's<br>
face and figure visibly increased, and he rattled the door and flung<br>
himself against it. Was his enemy to escape him after all?<br>
<br>
But what was that? The red in his eye had caught sight of Peter's<br>
medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach. He fathomed what it was<br>
straightaway, and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power.<br>
<br>
Lest he should be taken alive, Hook always carried about his person a<br>
dreadful drug, blended by himself of all the death-dealing rings that<br>
had come into his possession. These he had boiled down into a yellow<br>
liquid quite unknown to science, which was probably the most virulent<br>
poison in existence.<br>
<br>
Five drops of this he now added to Peter's cup. His hand shook, but it<br>
was in exultation rather than in shame. As he did it he avoided glancing<br>
at the sleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve him; merely to avoid<br>
spilling. Then one long gloating look he cast upon his victim, and<br>
turning, wormed his way with difficulty up the tree. As he emerged<br>
at the top he looked the very spirit of evil breaking from its hole.<br>
Donning his hat at its most rakish angle, he wound his cloak around him,<br>
holding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the night,<br>
of which it was the blackest part, and muttering strangely to himself,<br>
stole away through the trees.<br>
<br>
Peter slept on. The light guttered [burned to edges] and went out,<br>
leaving the tenement in darkness; but still he slept. It must have been<br>
not less than ten o'clock by the crocodile, when he suddenly sat up in<br>
his bed, wakened by he knew not what. It was a soft cautious tapping on<br>
the door of his tree.<br>
<br>
Soft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister. Peter felt for<br>
his dagger till his hand gripped it. Then he spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who is that?&quot;<br>
<br>
For long there was no answer: then again the knock.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
No answer.<br>
<br>
He was thrilled, and he loved being thrilled. In two strides he reached<br>
the door. Unlike Slightly's door, it filled the aperture [opening], so<br>
that he could not see beyond it, nor could the one knocking see him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I won't open unless you speak,&quot; Peter cried.<br>
<br>
Then at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let me in, Peter.&quot;<br>
<br>
It was Tink, and quickly he unbarred to her. She flew in excitedly, her<br>
face flushed and her dress stained with mud.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, you could never guess!&quot; she cried, and offered him three
guesses.<br>
&quot;Out with it!&quot; he shouted, and in one ungrammatical sentence, as long
as<br>
the ribbons that conjurers [magicians] pull from their mouths, she told<br>
of the capture of Wendy and the boys.<br>
<br>
Peter's heart bobbed up and down as he listened. Wendy bound, and on the<br>
pirate ship; she who loved everything to be just so!<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll rescue her!&quot; he cried, leaping at his weapons. As he leapt he<br>
thought of something he could do to please her. He could take his<br>
medicine.<br>
<br>
His hand closed on the fatal draught.<br>
<br>
&quot;No!&quot; shrieked Tinker Bell, who had heard Hook mutter about his deed
as<br>
he sped through the forest.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why not?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It is poisoned.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hook.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't be silly. How could Hook have got down here?&quot;<br>
<br>
Alas, Tinker Bell could not explain this, for even she did not know the<br>
dark secret of Slightly's tree. Nevertheless Hook's words had left no<br>
room for doubt. The cup was poisoned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Besides,&quot; said Peter, quite believing himself &quot;I never fell
asleep.&quot;<br>
<br>
He raised the cup. No time for words now; time for deeds; and with one<br>
of her lightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught,<br>
and drained it to the dregs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, Tink, how dare you drink my medicine?&quot;<br>
<br>
But she did not answer. Already she was reeling in the air.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is the matter with you?&quot; cried Peter, suddenly afraid.<br>
<br>
&quot;It was poisoned, Peter,&quot; she told him softly; &quot;and now I am
going to be<br>
dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;O Tink, did you drink it to save me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But why, Tink?&quot;<br>
<br>
Her wings would scarcely carry her now, but in reply she alighted on his<br>
shoulder and gave his nose a loving bite. She whispered in his ear &quot;You<br>
silly ass,&quot; and then, tottering to her chamber, lay down on the bed.<br>
<br>
His head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt<br>
near her in distress. Every moment her light was growing fainter; and<br>
he knew that if it went out she would be no more. She liked his tears so<br>
much that she put out her beautiful finger and let them run over it.<br>
<br>
Her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said.<br>
Then he made it out. She was saying that she thought she could get well<br>
again if children believed in fairies.<br>
<br>
Peter flung out his arms. There were no children there, and it was night<br>
time; but he addressed all who might be dreaming of the Neverland, and<br>
who were therefore nearer to him than you think: boys and girls in their<br>
nighties, and naked papooses in their baskets hung from trees.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you believe?&quot; he cried.<br>
<br>
Tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate.<br>
<br>
She fancied she heard answers in the affirmative, and then again she<br>
wasn't sure.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you think?&quot; she asked Peter.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you believe,&quot; he shouted to them, &quot;clap your hands; don't
let Tink<br>
die.&quot;<br>
<br>
Many clapped.<br>
<br>
Some didn't.<br>
<br>
A few beasts hissed.<br>
<br>
The clapping stopped suddenly; as if countless mothers had rushed to<br>
their nurseries to see what on earth was happening; but already Tink was<br>
saved. First her voice grew strong, then she popped out of bed, then<br>
she was flashing through the room more merry and impudent than ever. She<br>
never thought of thanking those who believed, but she would have like to<br>
get at the ones who had hissed.<br>
<br>
&quot;And now to rescue Wendy!&quot;<br>
<br>
The moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his tree,<br>
begirt [belted] with weapons and wearing little else, to set out upon<br>
his perilous quest. It was not such a night as he would have chosen.<br>
He had hoped to fly, keeping not far from the ground so that nothing<br>
unwonted should escape his eyes; but in that fitful light to have<br>
flown low would have meant trailing his shadow through the trees, thus<br>
disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he was astir.<br>
<br>
He regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange<br>
names that they are very wild and difficult of approach.<br>
<br>
There was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion, at<br>
which happily he was an adept [expert]. But in what direction, for he<br>
could not be sure that the children had been taken to the ship? A<br>
light fall of snow had obliterated all footmarks; and a deathly silence<br>
pervaded the island, as if for a space Nature stood still in horror of<br>
the recent carnage. He had taught the children something of the forest<br>
lore that he had himself learned from Tiger Lily and Tinker Bell,<br>
and knew that in their dire hour they were not likely to forget it.<br>
Slightly, if he had an opportunity, would blaze [cut a mark in] the<br>
trees, for instance, Curly would drop seeds, and Wendy would leave her<br>
handkerchief at some important place. The morning was needed to search<br>
for such guidance, and he could not wait. The upper world had called<br>
him, but would give no help.<br>
<br>
The crocodile passed him, but not another living thing, not a sound, not<br>
a movement; and yet he knew well that sudden death might be at the next<br>
tree, or stalking him from behind.<br>
<br>
He swore this terrible oath: &quot;Hook or me this time.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now he crawled forward like a snake, and again erect, he darted across<br>
a space on which the moonlight played, one finger on his lip and his<br>
dagger at the ready. He was frightfully happy.<br>

        <p>1. The captured boys were ruthlessly plucked from their trees and tossed from one pirate to another. They were treated as if they were bales of goods being flung from hand to hand. However, Wendy, who came last, was treated differently. Captain Hook raised his hat to her, offered her his arm, and escorted her to the spot where the others were being gagged. Hook's demeanor was imposingly distinguished, and Wendy was too fascinated to cry out.</p>
        <p>2. Slightly, during the process of being tied up with ropes like the other boys, was found to be difficult to truss up because he had whittled his tree to make it fit him. Instead of reducing himself to fit the tree, he had altered the tree. The pirates, in their rage, kicked him. Captain Hook, rather than allowing further violence, ordered them to stop. Hook, with his keen mind, understood that Slightly's secret was that he had altered his tree to fit himself, preventing him from being tied up properly.</p>
        <p>3. When Hook finds himself alone in the fast-falling night, he tiptoes to Slightly's tree to ensure it provides him with a passage. Afterward, he remains brooding, and his thoughts lead him to Peter's underground home. He stealthily enters the home and discovers Peter asleep on the bed. This significant discovery allows Hook to believe that Peter is finally at his mercy. Unaware of the tragedy unfolding above, Peter is found fast asleep, and Hook, filled with exultation, plots his next move, setting the stage for a perilous encounter.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>14 THE PIRATE SHIP</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
       <br>
One green light squinting over Kidd's Creek, which is near the mouth of<br>
the pirate river, marked where the brig, the JOLLY ROGER, lay, low in<br>
the water; a rakish-looking [speedy-looking] craft foul to the hull,<br>
every beam in her detestable, like ground strewn with mangled feathers.<br>
She was the cannibal of the seas, and scarce needed that watchful eye,<br>
for she floated immune in the horror of her name.<br>
<br>
She was wrapped in the blanket of night, through which no sound from her<br>
could have reached the shore. There was little sound, and none agreeable<br>
save the whir of the ship's sewing machine at which Smee sat, ever<br>
industrious and obliging, the essence of the commonplace, pathetic Smee.<br>
I know not why he was so infinitely pathetic, unless it were because<br>
he was so pathetically unaware of it; but even strong men had to turn<br>
hastily from looking at him, and more than once on summer evenings he<br>
had touched the fount of Hook's tears and made it flow. Of this, as of<br>
almost everything else, Smee was quite unconscious.<br>
<br>
A few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks, drinking in the miasma<br>
[putrid mist] of the night; others sprawled by barrels over games of<br>
dice and cards; and the exhausted four who had carried the little house<br>
lay prone on the deck, where even in their sleep they rolled skillfully<br>
to this side or that out of Hook's reach, lest he should claw them<br>
mechanically in passing.<br>
<br>
Hook trod the deck in thought. O man unfathomable. It was his hour of<br>
triumph. Peter had been removed for ever from his path, and all the<br>
other boys were in the brig, about to walk the plank. It was his<br>
grimmest deed since the days when he had brought Barbecue to heel; and<br>
knowing as we do how vain a tabernacle is man, could we be surprised<br>
had he now paced the deck unsteadily, bellied out by the winds of his<br>
success?<br>
<br>
But there was no elation in his gait, which kept pace with the action of<br>
his sombre mind. Hook was profoundly dejected.<br>
<br>
He was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in the<br>
quietude of the night. It was because he was so terribly alone. This<br>
inscrutable man never felt more alone than when surrounded by his dogs.<br>
They were socially inferior to him.<br>
<br>
Hook was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would even at<br>
this date set the country in a blaze; but as those who read between the<br>
lines must already have guessed, he had been at a famous public school;<br>
and its traditions still clung to him like garments, with which indeed<br>
they are largely concerned. Thus it was offensive to him even now to<br>
board a ship in the same dress in which he grappled [attacked] her, and<br>
he still adhered in his walk to the school's distinguished slouch. But<br>
above all he retained the passion for good form.<br>
<br>
Good form! However much he may have degenerated, he still knew that this<br>
is all that really matters.<br>
<br>
From far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals, and through<br>
them came a stern tap-tap-tap, like hammering in the night when one<br>
cannot sleep. &quot;Have you been good form to-day?&quot; was their eternal<br>
question.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fame, fame, that glittering bauble, it is mine,&quot; he cried.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is it quite good form to be distinguished at anything?&quot; the tap-tap<br>
from his school replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am the only man whom Barbecue feared,&quot; he urged, &quot;and Flint
feared<br>
Barbecue.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Barbecue, Flint--what house?&quot; came the cutting retort.<br>
<br>
Most disquieting reflection of all, was it not bad form to think about<br>
good form?<br>
<br>
His vitals were tortured by this problem. It was a claw within him<br>
sharper than the iron one; and as it tore him, the perspiration dripped<br>
down his tallow [waxy] countenance and streaked his doublet. Ofttimes he<br>
drew his sleeve across his face, but there was no damming that trickle.<br>
<br>
Ah, envy not Hook.<br>
<br>
There came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution [death]. It<br>
was as if Peter's terrible oath had boarded the ship. Hook felt a gloomy<br>
desire to make his dying speech, lest presently there should be no time<br>
for it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Better for Hook,&quot; he cried, &quot;if he had had less ambition!&quot;
It was in<br>
his darkest hours only that he referred to himself in the third person.<br>
<br>
&quot;No little children to love me!&quot;<br>
<br>
Strange that he should think of this, which had never troubled him<br>
before; perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind. For long he<br>
muttered to himself, staring at Smee, who was hemming placidly, under<br>
the conviction that all children feared him.<br>
<br>
Feared him! Feared Smee! There was not a child on board the brig that<br>
night who did not already love him. He had said horrid things to them<br>
and hit them with the palm of his hand, because he could not hit with<br>
his fist, but they had only clung to him the more. Michael had tried on<br>
his spectacles.<br>
<br>
To tell poor Smee that they thought him lovable! Hook itched to do it,<br>
but it seemed too brutal. Instead, he revolved this mystery in his<br>
mind: why do they find Smee lovable? He pursued the problem like the<br>
sleuth-hound that he was. If Smee was lovable, what was it that made him<br>
so? A terrible answer suddenly presented itself--&quot;Good form?&quot;<br>
<br>
Had the bo'sun good form without knowing it, which is the best form of<br>
all?<br>
<br>
He remembered that you have to prove you don't know you have it before<br>
you are eligible for Pop [an elite social club at Eton].<br>
<br>
With a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over Smee's head; but he did<br>
not tear. What arrested him was this reflection:<br>
<br>
&quot;To claw a man because he is good form, what would that be?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bad form!&quot;<br>
<br>
The unhappy Hook was as impotent [powerless] as he was damp, and he fell<br>
forward like a cut flower.<br>
<br>
His dogs thinking him out of the way for a time, discipline instantly<br>
relaxed; and they broke into a bacchanalian [drunken] dance, which<br>
brought him to his feet at once, all traces of human weakness gone, as<br>
if a bucket of water had passed over him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Quiet, you scugs,&quot; he cried, &quot;or I'll cast anchor in you;&quot;
and at once<br>
the din was hushed. &quot;Are all the children chained, so that they cannot<br>
fly away?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ay, ay.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then hoist them up.&quot;<br>
<br>
The wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold, all except Wendy,<br>
and ranged in line in front of him. For a time he seemed unconscious<br>
of their presence. He lolled at his ease, humming, not unmelodiously,<br>
snatches of a rude song, and fingering a pack of cards. Ever and anon<br>
the light from his cigar gave a touch of colour to his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now then, bullies,&quot; he said briskly, &quot;six of you walk the plank<br>
to-night, but I have room for two cabin boys. Which of you is it to be?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't irritate him unnecessarily,&quot; had been Wendy's instructions in<br>
the hold; so Tootles stepped forward politely. Tootles hated the idea<br>
of signing under such a man, but an instinct told him that it would<br>
be prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person; and though a<br>
somewhat silly boy, he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be<br>
the buffer. All children know this about mothers, and despise them for<br>
it, but make constant use of it.<br>
<br>
So Tootles explained prudently, &quot;You see, sir, I don't think my mother<br>
would like me to be a pirate. Would your mother like you to be a pirate,<br>
Slightly?&quot;<br>
<br>
He winked at Slightly, who said mournfully, &quot;I don't think so,&quot; as if<br>
he wished things had been otherwise. &quot;Would your mother like you to be a<br>
pirate, Twin?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't think so,&quot; said the first twin, as clever as the others.
&quot;Nibs,<br>
would--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Stow this gab,&quot; roared Hook, and the spokesmen were dragged back.
&quot;You,<br>
boy,&quot; he said, addressing John, &quot;you look as if you had a little
pluck<br>
in you. Didst never want to be a pirate, my hearty?&quot;<br>
<br>
Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths. prep.; and<br>
he was struck by Hook's picking him out.<br>
<br>
&quot;I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack,&quot; he said
diffidently.<br>
<br>
&quot;And a good name too. We'll call you that here, bully, if you join.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you think, Michael?&quot; asked John.<br>
<br>
&quot;What would you call me if I join?&quot; Michael demanded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Blackbeard Joe.&quot;<br>
<br>
Michael was naturally impressed. &quot;What do you think, John?&quot; He wanted<br>
John to decide, and John wanted him to decide.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King?&quot; John inquired.<br>
<br>
Through Hook's teeth came the answer: &quot;You would have to swear, 'Down<br>
with the King.'&quot;<br>
<br>
Perhaps John had not behaved very well so far, but he shone out now.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then I refuse,&quot; he cried, banging the barrel in front of Hook.<br>
<br>
&quot;And I refuse,&quot; cried Michael.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rule Britannia!&quot; squeaked Curly.<br>
<br>
The infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth; and Hook roared out,<br>
&quot;That seals your doom. Bring up their mother. Get the plank ready.&quot;<br>
<br>
They were only boys, and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco<br>
preparing the fatal plank. But they tried to look brave when Wendy was<br>
brought up.<br>
<br>
No words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates. To the<br>
boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling; but all that<br>
she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years. There was not<br>
a porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have written with<br>
your finger &quot;Dirty pig&quot;; and she had already written it on several.
But<br>
as the boys gathered round her she had no thought, of course, save for<br>
them.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, my beauty,&quot; said Hook, as if he spoke in syrup, &quot;you are to
see<br>
your children walk the plank.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fine gentlemen though he was, the intensity of his communings had soiled<br>
his ruff, and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it. With a hasty<br>
gesture he tried to hide it, but he was too late.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are they to die?&quot; asked Wendy, with a look of such frightful
contempt<br>
that he nearly fainted.<br>
<br>
&quot;They are,&quot; he snarled. &quot;Silence all,&quot; he called
gloatingly, &quot;for a<br>
mother's last words to her children.&quot;<br>
<br>
At this moment Wendy was grand. &quot;These are my last words, dear boys,&quot;<br>
she said firmly. &quot;I feel that I have a message to you from your real<br>
mothers, and it is this: 'We hope our sons will die like English<br>
gentlemen.'&quot;<br>
<br>
Even the pirates were awed, and Tootles cried out hysterically, &quot;I am<br>
going to do what my mother hopes. What are you to do, Nibs?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What my mother hopes. What are you to do, Twin?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What my mother hopes. John, what are--&quot;<br>
<br>
But Hook had found his voice again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tie her up!&quot; he shouted.<br>
<br>
It was Smee who tied her to the mast. &quot;See here, honey,&quot; he
whispered,<br>
&quot;I'll save you if you promise to be my mother.&quot;<br>
<br>
But not even for Smee would she make such a promise. &quot;I would almost<br>
rather have no children at all,&quot; she said disdainfully [scornfully].<br>
<br>
It is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as Smee tied her to<br>
the mast; the eyes of all were on the plank: that last little walk they<br>
were about to take. They were no longer able to hope that they would<br>
walk it manfully, for the capacity to think had gone from them; they<br>
could stare and shiver only.<br>
<br>
Hook smiled on them with his teeth closed, and took a step toward Wendy.<br>
His intention was to turn her face so that she should see the boys<br>
walking the plank one by one. But he never reached her, he never heard<br>
the cry of anguish he hoped to wring from her. He heard something else<br>
instead.<br>
<br>
It was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile.<br>
<br>
They all heard it--pirates, boys, Wendy; and immediately every head was<br>
blown in one direction; not to the water whence the sound proceeded, but<br>
toward Hook. All knew that what was about to happen concerned him alone,<br>
and that from being actors they were suddenly become spectators.<br>
<br>
Very frightful was it to see the change that came over him. It was as if<br>
he had been clipped at every joint. He fell in a little heap.<br>
<br>
The sound came steadily nearer; and in advance of it came this ghastly<br>
thought, &quot;The crocodile is about to board the ship!&quot;<br>
<br>
Even the iron claw hung inactive; as if knowing that it was no intrinsic<br>
part of what the attacking force wanted. Left so fearfully alone, any<br>
other man would have lain with his eyes shut where he fell: but the<br>
gigantic brain of Hook was still working, and under its guidance he<br>
crawled on the knees along the deck as far from the sound as he could<br>
go. The pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him, and it was only<br>
when he brought up against the bulwarks that he spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hide me!&quot; he cried hoarsely.<br>
<br>
They gathered round him, all eyes averted from the thing that was coming<br>
aboard. They had no thought of fighting it. It was Fate.<br>
<br>
Only when Hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of<br>
the boys so that they could rush to the ship's side to see the crocodile<br>
climbing it. Then they got the strangest surprise of the Night of<br>
Nights; for it was no crocodile that was coming to their aid. It was<br>
Peter.<br>
<br>
He signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might<br>
rouse suspicion. Then he went on ticking.<br>

        <p>1. The pirate ship was called the "JOLLY ROGER," which is a traditional name for pirate flags. In the description, the ship appeared low in the water, rakish-looking, and foul to the hull. It was characterized as a detestable craft, and every beam in it looked mangled, resembling a cannibal of the seas.</p>
        <p>2. Captain Hook's emotional state is described as profoundly dejected despite his triumph in removing Peter from his path. He walks the deck in thought, showing signs of being terribly alone. He reflects on his personal struggles with maintaining "good form" and is haunted by the question of what truly makes one have good form. He experiences a presentiment of his early death and expresses regrets about his ambitions.</p>
        <p>3. The unexpected turn of events is that it's not the crocodile but Peter who arrives to confront the pirates. When the crocodile's ticking is heard, the pirates, including Captain Hook, are initially terrified and believe that the crocodile is about to board the ship. However, when they turn to see what's coming, they are surprised to find that it is Peter. Captain Hook, who had been hidden from the crocodile, asks to be hidden by the pirates, showing his fear of the ticking crocodile.</p>

    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
        <br>
Odd things happen to all of us on our way through life without our<br>
noticing for a time that they have happened. Thus, to take an instance,<br>
we suddenly discover that we have been deaf in one ear for we don't know<br>
how long, but, say, half an hour. Now such an experience had come that<br>
night to Peter. When last we saw him he was stealing across the island<br>
with one finger to his lips and his dagger at the ready. He had seen the<br>
crocodile pass by without noticing anything peculiar about it, but by<br>
and by he remembered that it had not been ticking. At first he thought<br>
this eerie, but soon concluded rightly that the clock had run down.<br>
<br>
Without giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a<br>
fellow-creature thus abruptly deprived of its closest companion, Peter<br>
began to consider how he could turn the catastrophe to his own use;<br>
and he decided to tick, so that wild beasts should believe he was the<br>
crocodile and let him pass unmolested. He ticked superbly, but with one<br>
unforeseen result. The crocodile was among those who heard the sound,<br>
and it followed him, though whether with the purpose of regaining what<br>
it had lost, or merely as a friend under the belief that it was again<br>
ticking itself, will never be certainly known, for, like slaves to a<br>
fixed idea, it was a stupid beast.<br>
<br>
Peter reached the shore without mishap, and went straight on, his legs<br>
encountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new<br>
element. Thus many animals pass from land to water, but no other human<br>
of whom I know. As he swam he had but one thought: &quot;Hook or me this<br>
time.&quot; He had ticked so long that he now went on ticking without knowing<br>
that he was doing it. Had he known he would have stopped, for to board<br>
the brig by help of the tick, though an ingenious idea, had not occurred<br>
to him.<br>
<br>
On the contrary, he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a<br>
mouse; and he was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him, with Hook<br>
in their midst as abject as if he had heard the crocodile.<br>
<br>
The crocodile! No sooner did Peter remember it than he heard the<br>
ticking. At first he thought the sound did come from the crocodile,<br>
and he looked behind him swiftly. Then he realised that he was doing it<br>
himself, and in a flash he understood the situation. &quot;How clever of
me!&quot;<br>
he thought at once, and signed to the boys not to burst into applause.<br>
<br>
It was at this moment that Ed Teynte the quartermaster emerged from the<br>
forecastle and came along the deck. Now, reader, time what happened by<br>
your watch. Peter struck true and deep. John clapped his hands on the<br>
ill-fated pirate's mouth to stifle the dying groan. He fell forward.<br>
Four boys caught him to prevent the thud. Peter gave the signal, and the<br>
carrion was cast overboard. There was a splash, and then silence. How<br>
long has it taken?<br>
<br>
&quot;One!&quot; (Slightly had begun to count.)<br>
<br>
None too soon, Peter, every inch of him on tiptoe, vanished into the<br>
cabin; for more than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look<br>
round. They could hear each other's distressed breathing now, which<br>
showed them that the more terrible sound had passed.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's gone, captain,&quot; Smee said, wiping off his spectacles.
&quot;All's still<br>
again.&quot;<br>
<br>
Slowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff, and listened so intently<br>
that he could have caught the echo of the tick. There was not a sound,<br>
and he drew himself up firmly to his full height.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then here's to Johnny Plank!&quot; he cried brazenly, hating the boys
more<br>
than ever because they had seen him unbend. He broke into the villainous<br>
ditty:<br>
<br>
     &quot;Yo ho, yo ho, the frisky plank,<br>
     You walks along it so,<br>
     Till it goes down and you goes down<br>
     To Davy Jones below!&quot;<br>
<br>
To terrorize the prisoners the more, though with a certain loss of<br>
dignity, he danced along an imaginary plank, grimacing at them as he<br>
sang; and when he finished he cried, &quot;Do you want a touch of the cat [o'<br>
nine tails] before you walk the plank?&quot;<br>
<br>
At that they fell on their knees. &quot;No, no!&quot; they cried so piteously
that<br>
every pirate smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fetch the cat, Jukes,&quot; said Hook; &quot;it's in the cabin.&quot;<br>
<br>
The cabin! Peter was in the cabin! The children gazed at each other.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ay, ay,&quot; said Jukes blithely, and he strode into the cabin. They<br>
followed him with their eyes; they scarce knew that Hook had resumed his<br>
song, his dogs joining in with him:<br>
<br>
     &quot;Yo ho, yo ho, the scratching cat,<br>
     Its tails are nine, you know,<br>
     And when they're writ upon your back--&quot;<br>
<br>
What was the last line will never be known, for of a sudden the song was<br>
stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin. It wailed through the ship,<br>
and died away. Then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood<br>
by the boys, but to the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech.<br>
<br>
&quot;What was that?&quot; cried Hook.<br>
<br>
&quot;Two,&quot; said Slightly solemnly.<br>
<br>
The Italian Cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin.<br>
He tottered out, haggard.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's the matter with Bill Jukes, you dog?&quot; hissed Hook, towering
over<br>
him.<br>
<br>
&quot;The matter wi' him is he's dead, stabbed,&quot; replied Cecco in a hollow<br>
voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bill Jukes dead!&quot; cried the startled pirates.<br>
<br>
&quot;The cabin's as black as a pit,&quot; Cecco said, almost gibbering,
&quot;but<br>
there is something terrible in there: the thing you heard crowing.&quot;<br>
<br>
The exultation of the boys, the lowering looks of the pirates, both were<br>
seen by Hook.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cecco,&quot; he said in his most steely voice, &quot;go back and fetch me
out<br>
that doodle-doo.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cecco, bravest of the brave, cowered before his captain, crying &quot;No,<br>
no&quot;; but Hook was purring to his claw.<br>
<br>
&quot;Did you say you would go, Cecco?&quot; he said musingly.<br>
<br>
Cecco went, first flinging his arms despairingly. There was no more<br>
singing, all listened now; and again came a death-screech and again a<br>
crow.<br>
<br>
No one spoke except Slightly. &quot;Three,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
Hook rallied his dogs with a gesture. &quot;'S'death and odds fish,&quot; he<br>
thundered, &quot;who is to bring me that doodle-doo?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait till Cecco comes out,&quot; growled Starkey, and the others took up
the<br>
cry.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think I heard you volunteer, Starkey,&quot; said Hook, purring again.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, by thunder!&quot; Starkey cried.<br>
<br>
&quot;My hook thinks you did,&quot; said Hook, crossing to him. &quot;I wonder
if it<br>
would not be advisable, Starkey, to humour the hook?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll swing before I go in there,&quot; replied Starkey doggedly, and
again<br>
he had the support of the crew.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is this mutiny?&quot; asked Hook more pleasantly than ever.
&quot;Starkey's<br>
ringleader!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Captain, mercy!&quot; Starkey whimpered, all of a tremble now.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shake hands, Starkey,&quot; said Hook, proffering his claw.<br>
<br>
Starkey looked round for help, but all deserted him. As he backed up<br>
Hook advanced, and now the red spark was in his eye. With a despairing<br>
scream the pirate leapt upon Long Tom and precipitated himself into the<br>
sea.<br>
<br>
&quot;Four,&quot; said Slightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;And now,&quot; Hook said courteously, &quot;did any other gentlemen say
mutiny?&quot;<br>
Seizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacing gesture, &quot;I'll<br>
bring out that doodle-doo myself,&quot; he said, and sped into the cabin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Five.&quot; How Slightly longed to say it. He wetted his lips to be
ready,<br>
but Hook came staggering out, without his lantern.<br>
<br>
&quot;Something blew out the light,&quot; he said a little unsteadily.<br>
<br>
&quot;Something!&quot; echoed Mullins.<br>
<br>
&quot;What of Cecco?&quot; demanded Noodler.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's as dead as Jukes,&quot; said Hook shortly.<br>
<br>
His reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably,<br>
and the mutinous sounds again broke forth. All pirates are<br>
superstitious, and Cookson cried, &quot;They do say the surest sign a ship's<br>
accurst is when there's one on board more than can be accounted for.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I've heard,&quot; muttered Mullins, &quot;he always boards the pirate
craft last.<br>
Had he a tail, captain?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They say,&quot; said another, looking viciously at Hook, &quot;that when
he comes<br>
it's in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Had he a hook, captain?&quot; asked Cookson insolently; and one after<br>
another took up the cry, &quot;The ship's doomed!&quot; At this the children
could<br>
not resist raising a cheer. Hook had well-nigh forgotten his prisoners,<br>
but as he swung round on them now his face lit up again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lads,&quot; he cried to his crew, &quot;now here's a notion. Open the
cabin door<br>
and drive them in. Let them fight the doodle-doo for their lives. If<br>
they kill him, we're so much the better; if he kills them, we're none<br>
the worse.&quot;<br>
<br>
For the last time his dogs admired Hook, and devotedly they did his<br>
bidding. The boys, pretending to struggle, were pushed into the cabin<br>
and the door was closed on them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, listen!&quot; cried Hook, and all listened. But not one dared to
face<br>
the door. Yes, one, Wendy, who all this time had been bound to the mast.<br>
It was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watching, it was for<br>
the reappearance of Peter.<br>
<br>
She had not long to wait. In the cabin he had found the thing for which<br>
he had gone in search: the key that would free the children of their<br>
manacles, and now they all stole forth, armed with such weapons as they<br>
could find. First signing them to hide, Peter cut Wendy's bonds,<br>
and then nothing could have been easier than for them all to fly off<br>
together; but one thing barred the way, an oath, &quot;Hook or me this
time.&quot;<br>
So when he had freed Wendy, he whispered for her to conceal herself with<br>
the others, and himself took her place by the mast, her cloak around him<br>
so that he should pass for her. Then he took a great breath and crowed.<br>
<br>
To the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the<br>
cabin; and they were panic-stricken. Hook tried to hearten them; but<br>
like the dogs he had made them they showed him their fangs, and he knew<br>
that if he took his eyes off them now they would leap at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lads,&quot; he said, ready to cajole or strike as need be, but never<br>
quailing for an instant, &quot;I've thought it out. There's a Jonah
aboard.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ay,&quot; they snarled, &quot;a man wi' a hook.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, lads, no, it's the girl. Never was luck on a pirate ship wi' a<br>
woman on board. We'll right the ship when she's gone.&quot;<br>
<br>
Some of them remembered that this had been a saying of Flint's. &quot;It's<br>
worth trying,&quot; they said doubtfully.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fling the girl overboard,&quot; cried Hook; and they made a rush at the<br>
figure in the cloak.<br>
<br>
&quot;There's none can save you now, missy,&quot; Mullins hissed jeeringly.<br>
<br>
&quot;There's one,&quot; replied the figure.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who's that?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Peter Pan the avenger!&quot; came the terrible answer; and as he spoke
Peter<br>
flung off his cloak. Then they all knew who 'twas that had been undoing<br>
them in the cabin, and twice Hook essayed to speak and twice he failed.<br>
In that frightful moment I think his fierce heart broke.<br>
<br>
At last he cried, &quot;Cleave him to the brisket!&quot; but without
conviction.<br>
<br>
&quot;Down, boys, and at them!&quot; Peter's voice rang out; and in another
moment<br>
the clash of arms was resounding through the ship. Had the pirates kept<br>
together it is certain that they would have won; but the onset came<br>
when they were still unstrung, and they ran hither and thither, striking<br>
wildly, each thinking himself the last survivor of the crew. Man to man<br>
they were the stronger; but they fought on the defensive only, which<br>
enabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose their quarry. Some of the<br>
miscreants leapt into the sea; others hid in dark recesses, where they<br>
were found by Slightly, who did not fight, but ran about with a lantern<br>
which he flashed in their faces, so that they were half blinded and<br>
fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords of the other boys. There was<br>
little sound to be heard but the clang of weapons, an occasional<br>
screech or splash, and Slightly monotonously counting--five--six--seven<br>
eight--nine--ten--eleven.<br>
<br>
I think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded Hook, who<br>
seemed to have a charmed life, as he kept them at bay in that circle<br>
of fire. They had done for his dogs, but this man alone seemed to be a<br>
match for them all. Again and again they closed upon him, and again and<br>
again he hewed a clear space. He had lifted up one boy with his hook,<br>
and was using him as a buckler [shield], when another, who had just<br>
passed his sword through Mullins, sprang into the fray.<br>
<br>
&quot;Put up your swords, boys,&quot; cried the newcomer, &quot;this man is
mine.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thus suddenly Hook found himself face to face with Peter. The others<br>
drew back and formed a ring around them.<br>
<br>
For long the two enemies looked at one another, Hook shuddering<br>
slightly, and Peter with the strange smile upon his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, Pan,&quot; said Hook at last, &quot;this is all your doing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ay, James Hook,&quot; came the stern answer, &quot;it is all my
doing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Proud and insolent youth,&quot; said Hook, &quot;prepare to meet thy
doom.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dark and sinister man,&quot; Peter answered, &quot;have at thee.&quot;<br>
<br>
Without more words they fell to, and for a space there was no advantage<br>
to either blade. Peter was a superb swordsman, and parried with dazzling<br>
rapidity; ever and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge that got<br>
past his foe's defence, but his shorter reach stood him in ill stead,<br>
and he could not drive the steel home. Hook, scarcely his inferior in<br>
brilliancy, but not quite so nimble in wrist play, forced him back by<br>
the weight of his onset, hoping suddenly to end all with a favourite<br>
thrust, taught him long ago by Barbecue at Rio; but to his astonishment<br>
he found this thrust turned aside again and again. Then he sought to<br>
close and give the quietus with his iron hook, which all this time had<br>
been pawing the air; but Peter doubled under it and, lunging fiercely,<br>
pierced him in the ribs. At the sight of his own blood, whose peculiar<br>
colour, you remember, was offensive to him, the sword fell from Hook's<br>
hand, and he was at Peter's mercy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now!&quot; cried all the boys, but with a magnificent gesture Peter
invited<br>
his opponent to pick up his sword. Hook did so instantly, but with a<br>
tragic feeling that Peter was showing good form.<br>
<br>
Hitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him, but darker<br>
suspicions assailed him now.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pan, who and what art thou?&quot; he cried huskily.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm youth, I'm joy,&quot; Peter answered at a venture, &quot;I'm a little
bird<br>
that has broken out of the egg.&quot;<br>
<br>
This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that<br>
Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very<br>
pinnacle of good form.<br>
<br>
&quot;To't again,&quot; he cried despairingly.<br>
<br>
He fought now like a human flail, and every sweep of that terrible sword<br>
would have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it; but Peter<br>
fluttered round him as if the very wind it made blew him out of the<br>
danger zone. And again and again he darted in and pricked.<br>
<br>
Hook was fighting now without hope. That passionate breast no longer<br>
asked for life; but for one boon it craved: to see Peter show bad form<br>
before it was cold forever.<br>
<br>
Abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it.<br>
<br>
&quot;In two minutes,&quot; he cried, &quot;the ship will be blown to
pieces.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, now, he thought, true form will show.<br>
<br>
But Peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his hands,<br>
and calmly flung it overboard.<br>
<br>
What sort of form was Hook himself showing? Misguided man though he was,<br>
we may be glad, without sympathising with him, that in the end he was<br>
true to the traditions of his race. The other boys were flying around<br>
him now, flouting, scornful; and he staggered about the deck striking up<br>
at them impotently, his mind was no longer with them; it was slouching<br>
in the playing fields of long ago, or being sent up [to the headmaster]<br>
for good, or watching the wall-game from a famous wall. And his shoes<br>
were right, and his waistcoat was right, and his tie was right, and his<br>
socks were right.<br>
<br>
James Hook, thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell.<br>
<br>
For we have come to his last moment.<br>
<br>
Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger<br>
poised, he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea. He<br>
did not know that the crocodile was waiting for him; for we purposely<br>
stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him: a little mark<br>
of respect from us at the end.<br>
<br>
He had one last triumph, which I think we need not grudge him. As he<br>
stood on the bulwark looking over his shoulder at Peter gliding through<br>
the air, he invited him with a gesture to use his foot. It made Peter<br>
kick instead of stab.<br>
<br>
At last Hook had got the boon for which he craved.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bad form,&quot; he cried jeeringly, and went content to the crocodile.<br>
<br>
Thus perished James Hook.<br>
<br>
&quot;Seventeen,&quot; Slightly sang out; but he was not quite correct in his<br>
figures. Fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night; but two<br>
reached the shore: Starkey to be captured by the redskins, who made him<br>
nurse for all their papooses, a melancholy come-down for a pirate; and<br>
Smee, who henceforth wandered about the world in his spectacles, making<br>
a precarious living by saying he was the only man that Jas. Hook had<br>
feared.<br>
<br>
Wendy, of course, had stood by taking no part in the fight, though<br>
watching Peter with glistening eyes; but now that all was over she<br>
became prominent again. She praised them equally, and shuddered<br>
delightfully when Michael showed her the place where he had killed one;<br>
and then she took them into Hook's cabin and pointed to his watch which<br>
was hanging on a nail. It said &quot;half-past one!&quot;<br>
<br>
The lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all. She got<br>
them to bed in the pirates' bunks pretty quickly, you may be sure; all<br>
but Peter, who strutted up and down on the deck, until at last he fell<br>
asleep by the side of Long Tom. He had one of his dreams that night, and<br>
cried in his sleep for a long time, and Wendy held him tightly.<br>

        <p>1. Peter's original plan was to tick like the crocodile, hoping that wild beasts would mistake him for the crocodile and leave him alone. However, the plan backfired when the real crocodile, attracted by the ticking sound, followed Peter, and this led to a confrontation with the pirates.</p>
        <p>2. Peter went to the cabin to free the children from their manacles. The significant event was the confrontation between Peter and the pirates, leading to the defeat of the pirates and the death of Bill Jukes.</p>
        <p>3. The final battle between Peter and Hook was intense, with both displaying skill in swordplay. However, Peter's agility and Hook's desperation ultimately led to Hook's defeat. Instead of delivering a fatal blow, Peter kicked Hook, and the latter fell into the waiting jaws of the crocodile. Hook's last words were "Bad form," expressing his disappointment in Peter's refusal to deliver a more conventional and honorable death.</p>
