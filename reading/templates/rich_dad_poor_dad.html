        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Rich Dad Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!</strong> by Robert Kiyosaki is a transformative personal finance book that challenges traditional notions about wealth and money. Published in 1997, the book contrasts the financial philosophies of two father figures in Kiyosaki’s life: his biological father ("Poor Dad") and the father of his best friend ("Rich Dad"). Through their differing approaches to money, Kiyosaki shares timeless lessons on financial literacy, investment, and building wealth. The book aims to empower readers to rethink their relationship with money and take control of their financial future.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Summary</strong></p>
        <p>The book’s key insights are presented through lessons Kiyosaki learned from his Rich Dad:</p>

        <p><strong>1. The Rich Don’t Work for Money</strong><br>
        Rich Dad teaches that wealth is built by making money work for you, rather than working for money. This involves focusing on passive income through investments and assets.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Financial Literacy Is Essential</strong><br>
        Kiyosaki emphasizes the importance of understanding financial concepts such as income, expenses, assets, and liabilities. He explains that true wealth comes from acquiring assets that generate income.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Mind Your Own Business</strong><br>
        Instead of solely relying on employment income, Kiyosaki advises readers to develop side businesses or investments that build financial independence.</p>

        <p><strong>4. The History of Taxes and the Power of Corporations</strong><br>
        Rich Dad highlights how the wealthy use corporate structures to protect and grow their wealth. Kiyosaki explains how understanding tax laws can provide significant advantages.</p>

        <p><strong>5. The Rich Invent Money</strong><br>
        Wealthy individuals create opportunities through innovation, problem-solving, and calculated risk-taking. Kiyosaki encourages readers to adopt an entrepreneurial mindset.</p>

        <p><strong>6. Work to Learn, Not to Earn</strong><br>
        Rich Dad advises developing diverse skills to increase financial opportunities. He stresses the value of learning about sales, marketing, and financial management.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Story</strong></p>
        <p>One impactful story in the book describes Kiyosaki and his friend working for Rich Dad at a young age. Instead of being paid a salary, they learn to identify opportunities to create value. This experience underscores the principle of making money work for you and thinking beyond traditional employment.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Key Concepts and Explanation</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Assets vs. Liabilities</strong><br>
        Kiyosaki defines assets as items that put money in your pocket and liabilities as items that take money out. He emphasizes that financial success depends on accumulating assets while minimizing liabilities.</p>

        <p><strong>Passive Income</strong><br>
        Building passive income streams, such as rental properties or dividend-paying stocks, allows individuals to achieve financial independence.</p>

        <p><strong>The Rat Race</strong><br>
        Kiyosaki describes the "rat race" as the cycle of working for a paycheck to cover expenses. Breaking free requires building assets that generate income independent of work.</p>
