    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p><em>Drop the Ball</em> by Tiffany Dufu is an empowering manifesto for women seeking relief from the overwhelming expectations of modern life. Through memoir, research, and practical advice, Dufu challenges the myth that women must do everything perfectly and shows how letting go—dropping the ball—can lead to greater freedom, partnership, and purpose.</p>

    <p><strong>The Burden of the “Ideal Woman”</strong></p>
    <p>Dufu begins with her own experience as a high-achieving woman who became exhausted trying to fulfill every role perfectly—employee, wife, mother, volunteer, friend, homemaker. She describes how internalised expectations pressured her to anticipate everyone’s needs, manage every detail, and maintain control at home, even while working full-time.</p>
    <p>She calls these pressures the “unspoken job description of womanhood,” a culturally ingrained set of beliefs that lead women to overfunction while others underfunction.</p>

    <p><strong>The Meaning of Dropping the Ball</strong></p>
    <p>Dropping the ball is not about failing or neglecting responsibilities. It is a strategic decision to release tasks that do not align with your highest priorities. It means redefining success, letting go of perfectionism, and trusting others—even if they do things imperfectly or differently.</p>

    <p><strong>Redefining Leadership at Home</strong></p>
    <p>Dufu argues that home is the first place where leadership must be practiced. Running a household requires coordination, planning, communication, and decision-making. When women automatically assume this leadership role and refuse to relinquish control, they not only exhaust themselves but also prevent their partners from contributing fully.</p>
    <p>True partnership requires sharing ownership of domestic and emotional labour.</p>

    <p><strong>Clarifying Your Highest and Best Use</strong></p>
    <p>Dufu encourages women to identify their “highest and best use”—the unique contributions that align with their passions, strengths, and long-term goals. When women focus on these areas instead of trying to do everything, families become stronger, and women gain more space to thrive.</p>

    <p><strong>The Drop the Ball List</strong></p>
    <p>A practical tool in the book is creating a “Drop the Ball List”—tasks and expectations to release. These may include keeping a perfectly clean house, coordinating every activity, planning events, responding instantly to messages, or taking responsibility for others’ emotions.</p>
    <p>Letting go of these tasks opens time and emotional space for what truly matters.</p>

    <p><strong>The Power of Asking for Help</strong></p>
    <p>Dufu reframes asking for help as an act of leadership, not weakness. Women often hesitate because they fear burdening others or being judged. But clear requests for support strengthen relationships and enable collaboration. People generally want to contribute—they just need direction.</p>

    <p><strong>Embracing Imperfection</strong></p>
    <p>Dropping the ball requires accepting imperfection: wrinkled laundry, simpler meals, missed details. These imperfections do not diminish a family’s wellbeing. The real harm comes from burnout and resentment. “Good enough” becomes an empowering mindset.</p>

    <p><strong>The Role of Support Networks</strong></p>
    <p>Dufu emphasises community—friends, mentors, colleagues, neighbours, and professionals. Women thrive when they share emotional and practical labour instead of carrying it alone.</p>

    <p><strong>The Ripple Effect</strong></p>
    <p>When women drop the ball, partners step up, relationships become more equitable, and children learn healthier expectations of gender roles. Women gain time for career growth, creativity, and joy. Families become stronger because responsibilities are shared rather than centered on one person.</p>

    <p><strong>Why This Book Matters</strong></p>
    <p><em>Drop the Ball</em> is ultimately a call for women to reclaim agency, redefine success, and create homes grounded in partnership rather than perfection. Dufu shows that dropping the ball is not giving up—it is choosing wisely. It is the path toward balance, meaningful contribution, and freedom.</p>
