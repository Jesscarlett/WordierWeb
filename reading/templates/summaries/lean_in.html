    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p><em>Lean In</em> by Sheryl Sandberg is a bold, data-backed, and deeply personal exploration of women’s leadership, workplace inequality, and the cultural forces that hold women back from reaching their full potential. Drawing from research, personal experience as Facebook’s COO, and stories from women across industries, Sandberg outlines both the systemic barriers that limit women and the internal barriers that prevent them from stepping confidently into leadership roles. The result is a compelling call for women to “lean in” to their ambitions while also urging workplaces and society to evolve.</p>
    <p>The book opens with Sandberg acknowledging the complex landscape modern women inhabit. Today’s women are more educated than ever and are entering the workforce in record numbers—yet they remain disproportionately underrepresented at the highest levels of leadership. Few CEOs, political leaders, board chairs, or top executives are women. Instead of assuming this is due to personal choice or biological difference, Sandberg argues that cultural norms, workplace structures, and internalised expectations play a much larger role.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>The Double Bind and the Ambition Gap</strong></p>
    <p>One of the major themes is the double bind: women are expected to be nurturing, humble, and accommodating, but leaders are expected to be assertive, decisive, and authoritative. When women exhibit leadership traits, they are often labelled as aggressive or unlikable; when they avoid those traits, they are dismissed as weak. This “likability penalty” shapes how women are perceived and how they perceive themselves. Many internalise these biases, leading to self-doubt, hesitancy, or a tendency to step back before fully testing their limits.</p>
    <p>Sandberg famously calls this internal barrier “the leadership ambition gap.” From early childhood, boys are rewarded for leadership, while girls are praised for compliance. As adults, men confidently apply for jobs even if they meet only some of the criteria, while women hesitate unless they meet nearly all. Men negotiate more consistently, speak up more, and expect advancement; women often fear backlash, feel guilty advocating for themselves, or underestimate their own performance.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Sitting at the Table</strong></p>
    <p>Sandberg argues that women unintentionally hold themselves back through small but significant behaviours. One example is physical and symbolic space—women sit on the edges of meeting rooms, stay quiet during discussions, or hesitate to take credit for accomplishments. Her advice to women is both simple and profound: sit at the table. Claim space. Participate fully. Allow yourself to be seen and heard, even when it feels uncomfortable.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Don’t Leave Before You Leave</strong></p>
    <p>Another important theme is how women often “lean back” long before they need to—especially when they anticipate becoming mothers someday. Sandberg describes young women turning down promotions, declining travel opportunities, or avoiding stretch assignments because they assume these roles will conflict with future caregiving. But stepping back early creates a self-fulfilling cycle: career progression slows, opportunities diminish, and returning later becomes more difficult.</p>
    <p>Her advice is memorable: “Don’t leave before you leave.” Stay engaged until the moment an actual decision must be made, and even then, explore flexible options rather than assuming ambition and motherhood cannot coexist.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Equality Begins at Home</strong></p>
    <p>Sandberg emphasises that achieving equality in the workplace requires equality in the home. Research shows that women still perform the majority of domestic labour and childcare, even when both partners work full-time. This imbalance forces women to make more professional sacrifices and limits their ability to pursue leadership roles.</p>
    <p>She argues that the most important career decision a woman makes may be her choice of partner—someone who values equality, shares responsibilities, and supports her ambitions. When domestic labour is shared intentionally, both partners are better able to thrive.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Workplace Bias and Structural Challenges</strong></p>
    <p>The book explores the many subtle ways bias shapes professional experiences. Women are interrupted more often, are judged more harshly, and receive vaguer feedback than men. Studies show that identical résumés receive different responses depending on whether a man’s or woman’s name is on them. Mothers face discrimination and assumptions about reduced commitment, while fathers often receive praise.</p>
    <p>Sandberg stresses that while individual confidence is important, overcoming inequality requires institutional change. Workplaces must adopt flexible policies, parental leave, pay transparency, mentorship programs, and anti-bias training. Women cannot lean in effectively if the system itself pushes them out.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Mentorship, Sponsorship, and Networks</strong></p>
    <p>Sandberg discusses the critical difference between mentors and sponsors. Mentors advise you; sponsors actively advocate for you. Women often look for one perfect mentor, but Sandberg suggests building a broad, organic network of supporters. She also encourages women to mentor others, contributing to a cycle of empowerment that strengthens workplaces from within.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Imposter Syndrome and Personal Reflections</strong></p>
    <p>Sandberg is candid about her own struggles with imposter syndrome. She describes moments at the height of her career where she doubted her competence, worried about perception, or feared speaking up. By revealing her vulnerabilities, she demonstrates that even highly successful women battle self-doubt, and that confidence is often built through action rather than certainty.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>A Vision for the Future</strong></p>
    <p>The book concludes with a hopeful vision. Sandberg imagines a society where leadership is balanced across gender, where girls grow up without internal limits, and where both men and women are free to pursue ambition without judgment. She calls on individuals, families, workplaces, and governments to participate in building a world where equality is normal and expected.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, <em>Lean In</em> is not about telling women to work harder or do more. It is about challenging stereotypes, advocating for structural change, and encouraging women to trust themselves. It is an invitation to lean into ambition, take risks, embrace leadership, and help create a future where gender does not define opportunity.</p>
