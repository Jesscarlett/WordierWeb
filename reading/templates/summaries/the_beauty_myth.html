    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p><em>The Beauty Myth</em> by Naomi Wolf is a groundbreaking feminist critique that explores how cultural standards of female beauty are used as a form of social control. Published in 1990 yet still remarkably relevant today, the book argues that even as women have gained power in education, politics, and the workforce, a new form of oppression has intensified: the pressure to achieve an ever-narrower, ever-more-demanding beauty ideal. According to Wolf, the beauty myth is not about actual beauty—it is a political weapon that keeps women distracted, anxious, and compliant.</p>
    <p>Wolf begins by challenging the assumption that beauty standards are natural or universal. Instead, she argues that the beauty myth is a culturally constructed ideology designed to maintain patriarchy. As women break barriers in public life, the beauty myth rises to reassert control, pushing women to police their bodies, emotions, and identities. The myth tells women that their worth lies not in their skills or character but in appearance—youth, thinness, perfection, flawlessness.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Emotional Labor and the Beauty Industry</strong></p>
    <p>One of the book’s core arguments is that the beauty myth creates a form of <strong>“unpaid emotional labor”</strong> that consumes women’s time, money, and mental energy. Diet culture, anti-aging industries, cosmetic procedures, fitness pressures, clothing expectations, and endless self-monitoring all serve to keep women preoccupied. Wolf describes this as a “backlash” against feminism: when women gain external freedoms, new internal prisons appear.</p>
    <p>Wolf outlines the economic interests behind the beauty myth. The beauty, fashion, dieting, and cosmetic industries are multi-billion-dollar global forces that rely on women feeling insecure. The myth thrives because it is profitable. Women’s self-doubt fuels corporate success. Wolf argues that the myth encourages constant dissatisfaction—women are meant to chase an ideal they can never reach, because the goalposts keep shifting.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Health and Body Image</strong></p>
    <p>A major theme of the book is the connection between beauty standards and women’s physical health. Wolf exposes the dangers of extreme dieting, eating disorders, over-exercising, and body dysmorphia. She critiques the medical field for pathologising women’s bodies and participating in industries that profit from altering them. Wolf argues that “healthy” beauty norms often disguise unhealthy obsessions.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Workplace Discrimination</strong></p>
    <p>Wolf also examines the ways the beauty myth infiltrates the workplace. She argues that appearance is used to undermine professional women. Attractive women are sexualised; less conventionally attractive women are dismissed. Women who focus on grooming are accused of vanity; women who don’t are judged as unprofessional. This double bind creates what Wolf calls a “professional beauty qualification”—a hidden requirement that men do not face.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Relationships and Sexuality</strong></p>
    <p>Another critical section discusses how the beauty myth affects personal relationships. Wolf argues that the myth distorts intimacy and sexuality. For women, it creates anxiety about attractiveness, leading many to feel inadequate or unlovable unless they meet external standards. For men, the myth shapes expectations of female bodies, often influenced by media and pornography, causing dissatisfaction and unrealistic fantasies.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Psychological Toll and the Third Shift</strong></p>
    <p>Wolf also explores the psychological toll of the beauty myth. Women internalise criticism, compare themselves constantly, and feel shame for not meeting impossible ideals. This shame becomes a tool of control. The myth encourages women to focus inward on perceived flaws instead of outward on ambition, activism, or self-expression. Wolf argues that the beauty myth adds a <strong>“third shift”</strong> of labor to women’s lives: constant grooming, dieting, exercising, shopping, and appearance upkeep.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Media and Social Expectations</strong></p>
    <p>Wolf also examines how media and advertising uphold the beauty myth. Images of women are digitally altered, sexualised, and standardised. The media often presents beauty as a woman’s primary source of power—linking attractiveness to success, romance, and happiness. Yet this “power” is fragile, conditional, and short-lived. The myth divides women, preventing collective empowerment.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Discipline, Punishment, and Surveillance</strong></p>
    <p>Wolf argues that the beauty myth is not just about looking good; it is about enforcing discipline. It punishes aging, weight gain, and non-conformity. It rewards compliance with social approval and punishes rebellion with shame and exclusion. Many women experience chronic self-surveillance—monitoring calories, wrinkles, hair, skin, clothing—often without conscious awareness.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Conclusion: Dismantling the Myth</strong></p>
    <p>Despite its critical tone, <em>The Beauty Myth</em> ends with hope. Wolf argues that because the myth is constructed, it can also be dismantled. She encourages women to question beauty standards, practice self-compassion, reject unhealthy expectations, and support one another in resisting the myth. She urges society to redefine beauty as diverse, personal, and subjective.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, <em>The Beauty Myth</em> is a call to liberation. Wolf exposes the political, economic, and psychological machinery behind beauty culture and invites women to stop measuring themselves against impossible ideals. By seeing the beauty myth clearly for what it is, women can begin to break free from self-doubt and reclaim their energy, ambition, and authentic identity.</p>
