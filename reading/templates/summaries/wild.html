    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p><em>Wild</em> by Cheryl Strayed is a raw, intimate, and transformative memoir about grief, healing, and self-discovery through an 1,100-mile solo hike along the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). It is not a book about wilderness survival or athletic achievement—it is a story about a young woman who loses everything that once held her together, and who walks herself back to life one painful step at a time.</p>
    <p>The memoir begins with Cheryl at twenty-two, shattered by the death of her mother, Bobbi. Her mother’s sudden illness and passing leave her emotionally ungrounded. Cheryl’s world collapses: her family splinters, her marriage crumbles, and she spirals into self-destructive behaviour. She engages in affairs, becomes addicted to heroin, and detaches from the person she once was. Grief becomes the central force of her life—chaotic, overwhelming, and consuming.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>The Decision to Hike</strong></p>
    <p>Amid the wreckage, Cheryl discovers a guidebook about the Pacific Crest Trail, a route stretching from Mexico to Canada. Something about the vastness of the wilderness, the promise of solitude, and the possibility of a physical challenge stirs her. Without outdoor experience, training, or proper preparation, she decides to hike more than a thousand miles alone. Her reason is simple and instinctive: she needs to save herself.</p>
    <p>Cheryl sets out with a backpack so heavy she names it “Monster.” The pack becomes a symbol of her emotional load—grief, guilt, shame, and longing. The first days on the trail are brutal. Her body aches, her feet blister, and she struggles to pitch a tent, start a stove, and survive harsh conditions. Yet the physical suffering grounds her. With each step, the wilderness strips away distraction and forces her to confront the truth she had been avoiding.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Grief, Memory, and Healing</strong></p>
    <p>The trail becomes a journey through memory. Cheryl recalls her mother’s warmth and optimism, her difficult childhood before her mother escaped an abusive marriage, and the deep love that held her family together. She reflects on her failed marriage to Paul, whom she still cares for despite betraying him. Her flashbacks reveal a woman trying to carry unresolved pain, yearning for a way to forgive herself.</p>
    <p>Throughout her hike, Cheryl encounters other hikers, trail angels, and strangers at outposts. Their kindness reminds her of humanity’s goodness. At times, she faces danger—wildlife, dehydration, extreme weather, and unsettling encounters. These moments test her resilience. Rather than turning back, she learns to adapt and endure.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Nature as Mirror</strong></p>
    <p>Strayed intertwines the physical landscape with her emotional landscape. The harsh, beautiful terrain mirrors her turmoil—both unforgiving and healing. Nature is not romanticised. The trail is full of hunger, fear, isolation, and discomfort. Yet it is also full of wonder: lakes, mountains, forests, and star-filled nights. Walking becomes a meditation, a way of listening to herself again.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Transformation on the Trail</strong></p>
    <p>Cheryl’s relationship with her body changes. She begins the hike feeling broken—emotionally and physically. As the trail wears on, she becomes stronger and more connected to herself. The physical accomplishment of each mile is a tangible counterweight to her emotional pain. She confronts her mistakes—her infidelities, drug use, and recklessness—not with excuses but with honesty.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Stepping Into Her Mother’s Legacy</strong></p>
    <p>A poignant part of the memoir is Cheryl’s acceptance of her mother’s legacy. Her mother embodied resilience and unconditional love. Cheryl realises that honouring her mother means choosing life, not pain. The trail becomes a way of stepping into the strength her mother believed she had.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Reaching the Bridge of the Gods</strong></p>
    <p>As Cheryl nears the end of her journey, she feels a quiet sense of wholeness. Standing on the Bridge of the Gods between Oregon and Washington, she realises the journey was never about reaching the end but becoming the woman capable of walking the whole way. She does not know what her future holds, but she knows she is no longer lost.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
    <p>By the end of the memoir, Cheryl has forgiven herself, mourned her mother, accepted her past, and reclaimed her life. <em>Wild</em> is about the long, slow work of healing—not glamorous, but gritty and honest. It is about choosing to step forward even when the path hurts. It is about courage rooted in vulnerability. Ultimately, <em>Wild</em> is a testament to the power of nature, solitude, and perseverance—a reminder that sometimes we must get lost to find ourselves.</p>
