    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p><em>Survival of the Sickest: A Medical Maverick Discovers Why We Need Disease</em> by Dr. Sharon Moalem, published in 2007, presents a provocative and fascinating thesis: <strong>many of the diseases and genetic disorders we consider harmful today may have evolved because they once helped humans survive.</strong></p>
    <p>By weaving together evolutionary biology, medicine, and genetics, Moalem reframes disease not as a failure of evolution—but as a consequence of its success.</p>
    <p>This is a book about paradoxes: why conditions like hemochromatosis, diabetes, high cholesterol, and even anemia might once have been <em>advantages</em> in certain environments. In a world where medicine often treats symptoms, Moalem steps back and asks: what if those symptoms were once solutions?</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>The Central Idea: Evolution Favors Survival, Not Perfection</strong></p>
    <p>Moalem’s core message is that <strong>natural selection doesn’t care about long-term health, comfort, or longevity</strong>. It only “cares” about what increases the odds of reproduction in a given environment.</p>
    <p>Traits that are dangerous in today’s world may have been crucial in the past. In other words: <strong>being genetically predisposed to a disease might once have saved your ancestors’ lives</strong>.</p>
    <p>He calls this the “survival of the sickest”—the idea that some diseases survived because they conferred survival benefits under certain environmental pressures.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Hemochromatosis and the Black Death</strong></p>
    <p>One of the most compelling examples in the book is <strong>hemochromatosis</strong>, a genetic disorder in which the body absorbs too much iron. Left untreated, it can lead to liver failure, heart disease, and diabetes.</p>
    <p>But Moalem suggests that during the <strong>Black Death</strong>, hemochromatosis might have been a <em>protective trait</em>. Bacteria thrive on iron, and people with hemochromatosis store iron in tissues, not in blood plasma—making it less accessible to pathogens.</p>
    <p>This means those with the disorder may have been more likely to survive the plague, passing the gene on.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Diabetes and the Ice Age</strong></p>
    <p>Moalem explores the “thrifty gene” hypothesis and suggests that <strong>diabetes</strong> may have conferred a survival benefit in cold climates.</p>
    <p>High blood sugar can act as a natural antifreeze, preventing cell damage from extreme cold. In Ice Age Europe, a mild form of diabetes might have helped people survive freezing temperatures by protecting their tissues.</p>
    <p>Today, with an abundance of food and no Ice Age in sight, that same trait contributes to metabolic disease.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Cholesterol, Heart Disease, and Parasites</strong></p>
    <p>Another paradox Moalem investigates is <strong>cholesterol</strong>. While we associate high cholesterol with heart disease, Moalem notes that cholesterol plays a critical role in <strong>immune defense</strong>.</p>
    <p>Cholesterol-rich membranes are harder for viruses to penetrate. In an era of rampant infections and parasites, higher cholesterol may have helped defend against deadly pathogens.</p>
    <p>In modern times—with antibiotics, clean water, and vaccines—the balance has shifted, and the once-helpful trait becomes a risk factor.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Anemia and Malaria</strong></p>
    <p>Moalem also discusses <strong>iron-deficiency anemia</strong>, one of the most common nutritional problems worldwide.</p>
    <p>But in malaria-endemic regions, anemia may be protective. Like with hemochromatosis, limiting iron availability makes it harder for parasites like <em>Plasmodium</em> (the cause of malaria) to multiply in the bloodstream.</p>
    <p>In this way, a “deficiency” might actually be an evolutionary strategy.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>G6PD Deficiency and Genetic Trade-Offs</strong></p>
    <p><em>Survival of the Sickest</em> also explores <strong>G6PD deficiency</strong>, a genetic trait that can cause red blood cells to break down under stress (like after eating fava beans or taking certain medications).</p>
    <p>But in the context of malaria, this trait disrupts the parasite’s ability to thrive—again showing that what we consider a disorder today may have been an advantage in the past.</p>
    <p>This leads to one of the book’s main themes: <strong>genetic trade-offs</strong>. A single gene can have both positive and negative effects depending on the environment.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Epigenetics and Inherited Experience</strong></p>
    <p>In later chapters, Moalem explores <strong>epigenetics</strong>—how environmental factors can change gene expression without altering DNA.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How famine, stress, or toxins can affect not only an individual’s health, but that of their descendants.</li>
      <li>How gene expression patterns are influenced by nutrition, behavior, and exposure to pathogens.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Epigenetics supports Moalem’s broader argument: biology is not fixed. Evolution is not just about DNA—it’s also about <strong>how genes respond to changing environments</strong>.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Why This Book Matters</strong></p>
    <p><em>Survival of the Sickest</em> is a bold and accessible book that asks us to rethink what disease means. Rather than viewing illness solely as a flaw, Moalem asks us to consider its evolutionary context.</p>
    <p>By highlighting the adaptive benefits of harmful traits, he adds depth to our understanding of genetics, public health, and human survival.</p>
    <p>The book encourages a <strong>holistic and historical perspective on medicine</strong>—one that honors complexity and questions conventional wisdom.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Key Takeaways and Insights</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Many genetic disorders may have evolved as survival strategies in specific environments.</li>
      <li>Traits like hemochromatosis, diabetes, and anemia may have conferred resistance to infections or cold.</li>
      <li>Evolution selects for reproductive success—not long-term health.</li>
      <li>The same gene can be beneficial or harmful depending on context.</li>
      <li>Modern environments have changed the cost-benefit analysis of ancient adaptations.</li>
      <li>Cholesterol, iron, and blood sugar serve vital functions beyond their modern risk associations.</li>
      <li>Epigenetics shows that environmental effects can be passed down generations.</li>
      <li>Understanding the evolutionary roots of disease can lead to more nuanced and effective medical thinking.</li>
