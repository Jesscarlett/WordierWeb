        <p><strong>The Art of War</strong> by Sun Tzu is a timeless treatise on strategy, leadership, and conflict resolution. Written over 2,500 years ago in ancient China, the text has transcended its origins as a military manual to become a guide for strategic thinking in business, politics, and life. The book’s enduring relevance lies in its principles of adaptability, discipline, and understanding both oneself and the opponent.
