        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p>Part cookbook, part wellness manifesto, <em>The Clean Plate</em> by actress and wellness entrepreneur <strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong> is a visually appealing guide to eating for optimal health. Released in 2019 through her Goop brand, the book blends delicious, whole-food recipes with clean-eating principles and integrative health insights from top doctors and nutritionists.</p>
        <p>Paltrow’s goal is simple: to provide meals that are both healing and indulgent—nourishing the body without sacrificing taste.
