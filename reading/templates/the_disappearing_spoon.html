        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p><em>The Disappearing Spoon</em> by Sam Kean, published in 2010, is a story-filled journey through the periodic table of elements.</p>
        <p>Kean reveals the quirky, surprising, and sometimes dangerous ways that the elements have shaped science, history, and human lives.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>The Disappearing Spoon: The Curious Case of Gallium</strong></p>
        <p>Kean opens with the story of gallium—a metal that melts in hot tea, causing a spoon made from it to seemingly disappear.</p>
        <p>This clever trick captures the playful and surprising nature of the periodic table.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>The Building of the Periodic Table</strong></p>
        <p>Kean highlights Dmitri Mendeleev’s creation of the periodic table and his bold predictions of undiscovered elements.</p>
        <p>Mendeleev’s genius reshaped chemistry and showed that the elements form a logical, predictive system.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Rivalries, Accidents, and Scientific Feuds</strong></p>
        <p>The book is filled with stories of bitter scientific rivalries, naming disputes, and dangerous experiments that led to major discoveries—or deadly mistakes.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Elements That Changed the World</strong></p>
        <p>Kean explores elements that shaped history:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Radium:</strong> Marie Curie’s discovery that advanced medicine but caused radiation sickness.</li>
            <li><strong>Tungsten:</strong> Critical in weapon-making and military strategy.</li>
            <li><strong>Mercury and Lead:</strong> Once widely used, now known for their toxicity.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>The Strange and Deadly</strong></p>
        <p>Kean shares stories of thallium poisonings, lead’s toxic legacy in ancient Rome, and the destructive power of plutonium in nuclear weapons.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Elements in Art and Culture</strong></p>
        <p>The book connects elements to art, economy, and mental health:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cobalt:</strong> Used for blue pottery and paints.</li>
            <li><strong>Silver and Gold:</strong> Shaped human economies and societies.</li>
            <li><strong>Lithium:</strong> Essential in psychiatric medicine.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>The Subatomic World</strong></p>
        <p>Kean explains atomic structures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Helium’s ability to escape Earth’s gravity.</li>
            <li>Noble gases like neon and their unique glow.</li>
            <li>Why heavy elements are often unstable and radioactive.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>The Playfulness of Chemistry</strong></p>
        <p>Kean’s tone is playful and curious, showing that the periodic table is filled with tricks, surprises, and life-changing stories.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Key Takeaways and Insights</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The periodic table is a human story of discovery, rivalry, and imagination.</li>
            <li>Mendeleev’s system revolutionized chemistry and predicted future elements.</li>
            <li>Elements like radium, tungsten, and mercury shaped history and technology.</li>
            <li>Chemistry contains both life-saving and deadly substances.</li>
            <li>Elements appear in art, culture, medicine, and everyday life.</li>
            <li>Atomic structures explain why elements behave as they do.</li>
            <li>The periodic table is full of wonder, danger, and curiosity.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Why This Book Matters</strong></p>
        <p><em>The Disappearing Spoon</em> brings the periodic table to life through fascinating stories, unexpected twists, and human drama.</p>
        <p>Sam Kean invites readers to see the periodic table as a playful, powerful history of the elements that build our world—and shape our lives.</p>
