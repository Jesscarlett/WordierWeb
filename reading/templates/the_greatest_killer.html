    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p><em>The Greatest Killer: Smallpox in History</em> by Donald R. Hopkins, first published in 2002, is a gripping, authoritative account of one of the most devastating diseases in human history—<strong>smallpox</strong>.</p>
    <p>Hopkins, a physician and global health expert who played a key role in the final stages of smallpox eradication, weaves together science, history, epidemiology, and storytelling to show how smallpox shaped civilizations, changed the course of empires, and ultimately, became the first human disease ever eradicated.</p>
    <p>This is a book about disease, but also about human ingenuity, persistence, and global cooperation.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>The Scourge of Civilizations</strong></p>
    <p>Hopkins begins by laying out the historical toll of smallpox. For over 3,000 years, smallpox haunted humanity, killing hundreds of millions. It killed <strong>1 in 3 people</strong> it infected and left many survivors disfigured or blind.</p>
    <p>Some of the greatest figures in world history—Ramses V of Egypt, Queen Mary II of England, Peter II of Russia—succumbed to smallpox. Others, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, survived it and carried lifelong scars.</p>
    <p>Smallpox was not only a <strong>biological terror</strong>, but also a <strong>sociopolitical force</strong>—reshaping dynasties, populations, and the balance of power across continents.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>How Smallpox Spread</strong></p>
    <p>Hopkins details how smallpox spread along <strong>trade routes, wars, and colonization</strong>. It ravaged cities and villages alike, with particular impact on <strong>indigenous populations</strong> in the Americas, Australia, and elsewhere who had no prior exposure.</p>
    <p>When the Spanish arrived in the Americas, smallpox spread faster than their armies—killing millions and contributing to the fall of the Aztec and Inca empires.</p>
    <p>In the 18th century, smallpox killed an estimated <strong>400,000 Europeans every year</strong> and left many more blind. It became a <strong>childhood rite of passage</strong>, with outbreaks routinely sweeping through towns.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Early Attempts at Prevention: Variolation</strong></p>
    <p>Before vaccination, many societies practiced <strong>variolation</strong>—deliberately infecting people with smallpox in a controlled way to induce immunity.</p>
    <p>This risky procedure originated in Asia and Africa and later spread to Europe. While it reduced mortality, it also carried dangers—it could still cause death or start new outbreaks.</p>
    <p>Hopkins describes the debates, cultural resistance, and medical politics surrounding variolation, particularly in 18th-century England and colonial America.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Edward Jenner and the Birth of Vaccination</strong></p>
    <p>A turning point came in 1796, when <strong>Edward Jenner</strong> demonstrated that exposure to cowpox could protect against smallpox. This discovery led to the first true <strong>vaccine</strong>—a term derived from “vacca,” the Latin word for cow.</p>
    <p>Jenner’s innovation revolutionized medicine and public health. Vaccination spread across Europe and the world, though adoption was uneven and often resisted due to cultural, religious, and political objections.</p>
    <p>Hopkins explores the <strong>tensions between scientific progress and public fear</strong>, a theme that remains relevant today.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>The Long Road to Eradication</strong></p>
    <p>Despite the success of vaccination, smallpox remained endemic in many parts of the world well into the 20th century.</p>
    <p>Hopkins traces the slow, uneven progress of <strong>national vaccination programs</strong>, highlighting both breakthroughs and setbacks.</p>
    <p>Then, in 1967, the <strong>World Health Organization (WHO)</strong> launched a bold campaign to eradicate smallpox globally. Hopkins—who worked on this effort in Africa—offers a first-hand account of the challenges and triumphs of the campaign.</p>
    <p>Key strategies included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Surveillance and containment</strong>, rather than mass vaccination alone.</li>
      <li><strong>Ring vaccination</strong>: vaccinating contacts of confirmed cases to prevent spread.</li>
      <li><strong>Rapid response teams</strong> to investigate outbreaks.</li>
      <li><strong>Local engagement and education</strong> to build trust and compliance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The campaign overcame war zones, political resistance, and logistical nightmares to achieve its goal.</p>
    <p>In 1980, the WHO declared <strong>smallpox eradicated</strong>—a historic first.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>The Legacy of Eradication</strong></p>
    <p>Hopkins reflects on the significance of smallpox eradication. It proved that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Global cooperation in health is possible.</li>
      <li>Disease eradication is achievable with the right tools and commitment.</li>
      <li>Surveillance and response are as vital as vaccines.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>He also discusses the <strong>ongoing debate</strong> about what to do with the remaining lab samples of smallpox virus—whether to destroy them or keep them for research and security purposes.</p>
    <p>The book also touches on <strong>bioterrorism</strong> fears, given smallpox’s devastating potential if re-released.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Smallpox and Society</strong></p>
    <p>Beyond the science, Hopkins explores how smallpox influenced:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Religious beliefs</strong> and rituals.</li>
      <li><strong>Art and literature</strong> (including metaphors of disease in Shakespeare and Voltaire).</li>
      <li><strong>Colonialism and genocide</strong>, especially the use of infected blankets against Native Americans.</li>
      <li><strong>Economic development</strong>, as epidemics stalled trade, labor, and growth.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Smallpox is not just a story of microbes—it’s a lens through which to view <strong>power, inequality, resilience, and progress</strong>.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Why This Book Matters</strong></p>
    <p><em>The Greatest Killer</em> is a powerful, multidisciplinary account of how one virus changed the world—and how humanity fought back.</p>
    <p>It blends deep research with compelling narrative, showing that public health is not just about medicine, but about politics, culture, and determination.</p>
    <p>Hopkins’s firsthand experience gives the story urgency and realism. It is a <strong>case study in both devastation and hope</strong>.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>Key Takeaways and Insights</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Smallpox was one of the deadliest diseases in history, killing hundreds of millions.</li>
      <li>Its spread was tied to war, trade, colonization, and global inequality.</li>
      <li>Variolation and then vaccination were revolutionary, but adoption took centuries.</li>
      <li>The global eradication of smallpox is one of the greatest achievements in public health.</li>
      <li>Disease is not just biological—it’s political, cultural, and social.</li>
      <li>The smallpox story teaches us about preparedness, equity, and the power of cooperation.</li>
      <li>Understanding past pandemics informs how we handle future ones—with science, solidarity, and persistence.</li>
    </ul>
