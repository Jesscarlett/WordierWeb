        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p><em>The Longevity Diet</em> by biochemist <strong>Dr. Valter Longo</strong> presents a powerful strategy for living longer and healthier. Published in 2018, it merges decades of research on aging, fasting, and nutrition to deliver a science-backed guide to extending both lifespan and healthspan. Longo’s key innovation, the Fasting-Mimicking Diet (FMD), allows for cellular regeneration without complete food deprivation—reshaping how we think about longevity and metabolic health.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Summary</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Plant-based foundation:</strong> Emphasize legumes, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, olive oil, and fish.</li>
            <li><strong>Low protein before age 65:</strong> Keep animal protein low to reduce IGF-1, a driver of aging and disease.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthy fats and low sugar:</strong> Avoid added sugars and saturated fats; focus on natural, unprocessed foods.</li>
            <li><strong>Time-restricted eating:</strong> Eat within a 12-hour window to support metabolism and circadian rhythm.</li>
            <li><strong>Fasting-Mimicking Diet (FMD):</strong> A 5-day protocol done several times a year to mimic fasting benefits while still eating.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Core Concept</strong></p>
        <p>The core message of <em>The Longevity Diet</em> is: <strong>Strategic dietary choices, especially plant-based nutrition and periodic fasting, can activate cellular renewal, reduce inflammation, and prevent chronic disease—adding years of healthy life.</strong></p>
        <p>Longevity is encoded in our biology—it just needs the right cues to be unlocked.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Key Insights and Strategies</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Low protein = lower IGF-1:</strong> Animal protein increases growth hormones tied to aging and cancer.</li>
            <li><strong>Fasting triggers repair:</strong> The FMD promotes autophagy and stem cell regeneration.</li>
            <li><strong>Centenarians eat mostly plants:</strong> Long-lived populations consume little meat and high fiber diets.</li>
            <li><strong>Don’t snack all day:</strong> Time-restricted eating improves insulin sensitivity and digestion.</li>
            <li><strong>Prevention beats treatment:</strong> Begin healthy aging protocols in your 30s or 40s—not your 70s.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Quotes to Remember</strong></p>
        <blockquote>“The best medicine for longevity is prevention—starting decades before disease develops.”</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“Fasting is not starvation—it’s a natural, programmed part of our biology.”</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“Eat less protein, more plants, and don’t eat all the time.”</blockquote>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Practical Application</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Adopt a pescatarian Mediterranean diet:</strong> Use vegetables, legumes, olive oil, and low mercury fish as staples.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep protein below 40g/day (under 65):</strong> Unless frail or elderly, limit animal sources of protein.</li>
            <li><strong>Try the Fasting-Mimicking Diet:</strong> Do a 5-day cycle a few times a year under medical supervision.</li>
            <li><strong>Eat within 12 hours:</strong> Avoid grazing all day—keep meal times aligned with daylight hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Supplement if needed:</strong> Consider B12, calcium, or a multivitamin based on your diet and age.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Interesting Facts and Stories</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>IGF-1 is like fertilizer for aging:</strong> Reducing it slows cellular proliferation linked to cancer and aging.</li>
            <li><strong>The FMD is clinically proven:</strong> It improves cholesterol, blood sugar, and inflammation even in healthy people.</li>
            <li><strong>Blue Zones don't track macros:</strong> Longevity comes from cultural patterns of whole foods, community, and movement.</li>
            <li><strong>Fasting reboots the body:</strong> After FMD cycles, stem cells regenerate damaged tissue and improve immunity.</li>
            <li><strong>This is not extreme dieting:</strong> Longo advocates moderate, sustainable practices based on evolution and science.</li>
        </ul>
