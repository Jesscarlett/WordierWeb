        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p><em>The Paleo Solution: The Original Human Diet</em> by biochemist and former research scientist <strong>Robb Wolf</strong> is one of the most influential books in the modern paleo movement. Published in 2010, it combines <strong>cutting-edge science, evolutionary biology, and practical advice</strong> to argue that our modern diet is mismatched with our ancient genes.</p>
        <p>Wolf proposes that by returning to a hunter-gatherer style of eating—high in protein, vegetables, and healthy fats—we can reduce chronic disease, lose weight, and regain energy and vitality.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Summary</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Our bodies are genetically adapted to a pre-agricultural diet, but we now eat grains, dairy, sugar, and processed food.</li>
            <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Remove grains, legumes, dairy, sugar, and processed oils.</li>
            <li><strong>Paleo-friendly foods:</strong> Lean meats, fish, eggs, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and healthy fats like olive oil and avocado.</li>
            <li><strong>Beyond food:</strong> Prioritizes sleep, strength training, gut health, and stress reduction.</li>
            <li><strong>Tools included:</strong> A 30-day plan with meals, movement, and lifestyle upgrades.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Core Concept</strong></p>
        <p>The core message of <em>The Paleo Solution</em> is: <strong>Modern chronic disease stems from a mismatch between our ancient genes and our modern diet and lifestyle.</strong></p>
        <p>Returning to an ancestral pattern of eating and living reduces inflammation, balances hormones, and supports long-term health.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Key Insights and Strategies</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The gut is central to wellness:</strong> Grains and legumes can cause gut irritation and autoimmune issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Control insulin:</strong> A lower-carb, whole-food diet regulates blood sugar and reduces fat storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Sleep is crucial:</strong> Disrupted sleep affects cortisol, insulin, hunger, and mood.</li>
            <li><strong>Exercise ancestrally:</strong> Lift heavy things, walk daily, sprint occasionally.</li>
            <li><strong>Health is holistic:</strong> Diet, movement, sleep, and stress all work together.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Quotes to Remember</strong></p>
        <blockquote>“We are genetically wired to eat like our Paleolithic ancestors, not like 21st-century snackers.”</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“Chronic diseases are diseases of civilization—they didn’t exist in our hunter-gatherer ancestors.”</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“The closer you live to your genetic template, the healthier you’ll be.”</blockquote>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Practical Application</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Try a 30-day paleo reset:</strong> Eliminate grains, dairy, legumes, and sugar to see how your body responds.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook simple meals:</strong> Meat + veggies + good fat = every meal. Use herbs and spices liberally.</li>
            <li><strong>Move daily:</strong> Combine resistance training, walking, and brief high-intensity intervals.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimize sleep:</strong> Go to bed early, dim lights at night, and avoid screens before sleep.</li>
            <li><strong>Check ingredient labels:</strong> Hidden sugars, seed oils, and gluten are common in packaged foods.</li>
        </ul>
