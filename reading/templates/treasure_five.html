        <br>
THERE was no return of the mutineers--not so much as another shot out of<br>
the woods. They had &quot;got their rations for that day,&quot; as the captain
put<br>
it, and we had the place to ourselves and a quiet time to overhaul the<br>
wounded and get dinner. Squire and I cooked outside in spite of the<br>
danger, and even outside we could hardly tell what we were at, for<br>
horror of the loud groans that reached us from the doctor's patients.<br>
<br>
Out of the eight men who had fallen in the action, only three still<br>
breathed--that one of the pirates who had been shot at the loophole,<br>
Hunter, and Captain Smollett; and of these, the first two were as good<br>
as dead; the mutineer indeed died under the doctor's knife, and Hunter,<br>
do what we could, never recovered consciousness in this world. He<br>
lingered all day, breathing loudly like the old buccaneer at home in his<br>
apoplectic fit, but the bones of his chest had been crushed by the<br>
blow and his skull fractured in falling, and <span class=SpellE>some time</span>
in the following<br>
night, without sign or sound, he went to his Maker.<br>
<br>
As for the captain, his wounds were grievous indeed, but not dangerous.<br>
No organ was fatally injured. Anderson's ball--for it was Job that<br>
shot him first--had broken his shoulder-blade and touched the lung, not<br>
badly; the second had only torn and displaced some muscles in the calf.<br>
He was sure to recover, the doctor said, but in the meantime, and for<br>
weeks to come, he must not walk nor move his arm, nor so much as speak<br>
when he could help it.<br>
<br>
My own accidental cut across the knuckles was a flea-bite. Doctor<br>
Livesey patched it up with plaster and pulled my ears for me into the<br>
bargain.<br>
<br>
After dinner the squire and the doctor sat by the captain's side awhile<br>
in consultation; and when they had talked to their hearts' content, it<br>
being then a little past noon, the doctor took up his hat and pistols,<br>
girt on a cutlass, put the chart in his pocket, and with a musket over<br>
his shoulder crossed the palisade on the north side and set off briskly<br>
through the trees.<br>
<br>
Gray and I were sitting together at the far end of the block house, to<br>
be out of earshot of our officers consulting; and Gray took his pipe out<br>
of his mouth and fairly forgot to put it back again, so thunder-struck<br>
he was at this occurrence.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, in the name of Davy Jones,&quot; said he, &quot;is Dr. Livesey
mad?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why no,&quot; says I. &quot;He's about the last of this crew for that, I
take<br>
it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, shipmate,&quot; said Gray, &quot;mad he may not be; but if HE'S
not, you<br>
mark my words, I am.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I take it,&quot; replied I, &quot;the doctor has his idea; and if I am
right,<br>
he's going now to see Ben Gunn.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was right, as appeared later; but in the meantime, the house being<br>
stifling hot and the little patch of sand inside the palisade ablaze<br>
with midday sun, I began to get another thought into my head, which was<br>
not by any means so right. What I began to do was to envy the doctor<br>
walking in the cool shadow of the woods with the birds about him and the<br>
pleasant smell of the pines, while I sat grilling, with my clothes<br>
stuck to the hot resin, and so much blood about me and so many poor<br>
dead bodies lying all around that I took a disgust of the place that was<br>
almost as strong as fear.<br>
<br>
All the time I was washing out the block house, and then washing up<br>
the things from dinner, this disgust and envy kept growing stronger<br>
and stronger, till at last, being near a bread-bag, and no one then<br>
observing me, I took the first step towards my escapade and filled both<br>
pockets of my coat with biscuit.<br>
<br>
I was a fool, if you like, and certainly I was going to do a foolish,<br>
over-bold act; but I was determined to do it with all the precautions in<br>
my power. These biscuits, should anything befall me, would keep me, at<br>
least, from starving till far on in the next day.<br>
<br>
The next thing I laid hold of was a brace of pistols, and as I already<br>
had a powder-horn and bullets, I felt myself well supplied with arms.<br>
<br>
As for the scheme I had in my head, it was not a bad one in itself. I<br>
was to go down the sandy spit that divides the anchorage on the east<br>
from the open sea, find the white rock I had observed last evening, and<br>
ascertain whether it was there or not that Ben Gunn had hidden his boat,<br>
a thing quite worth doing, as I still believe. But as I was certain I<br>
should not be allowed to leave the enclosure, my only plan was to take<br>
French leave and slip out when nobody was watching, and that was so bad<br>
a way of doing it <span class=SpellE>as</span> made the thing itself wrong. But
I was only a boy,<br>
and I had made my mind up.<br>
<br>
Well, as things at last fell out, I found an admirable opportunity. The<br>
squire and Gray were busy helping the captain with his bandages, the<br>
coast was clear, I made a bolt for it over the stockade and into the<br>
thickest of the trees, and before my absence was observed I was out of<br>
cry of my companions.<br>
<br>
This was my second folly, far worse than the first, as I left but two<br>
sound men to guard the house; but like the first, it was a help towards<br>
saving all of us.<br>
<br>
I took my way straight for the east coast of the island, for I was<br>
determined to go down the sea side of the spit to avoid all chance of<br>
observation from the anchorage. It was already late in the afternoon,<br>
although still warm and sunny. As I continued to thread the tall woods,<br>
I could hear from far before me not only the continuous thunder of the<br>
surf, but a certain tossing of foliage and grinding of boughs which<br>
showed me the sea breeze had set in higher than usual. Soon cool<br>
draughts of air began to reach me, and a few steps farther I came forth<br>
into the open borders of the <span class=GramE>grove, and</span> saw the sea
lying blue and sunny<br>
to the horizon and the surf tumbling and tossing its foam along the<br>
beach.<br>
<br>
I have never seen the sea quiet round Treasure Island. The sun might<br>
blaze overhead, the air be without a breath, the surface smooth and<br>
blue, but still these great rollers would be running along all the<br>
external coast, thundering and thundering by day and night; and I scarce<br>
believe there is one spot in the island where a man would be out of<br>
earshot of their noise.<br>
<br>
I walked along beside the surf with great enjoyment, till, thinking<br>
I was now <span class=SpellE>got</span> far enough to the south, I took the
cover of some thick<br>
bushes and crept warily up to the ridge of the spit.<br>
<br>
Behind me was the sea, in front the anchorage. The sea breeze, as though<br>
it had the sooner blown itself out by its unusual violence, was already<br>
at an end; it had been succeeded by light, variable airs from the south<br>
and south-east, carrying great banks of fog; and the anchorage, under<br>
lee of Skeleton Island, lay still and leaden as when first we entered<br>
it. The HISPANIOLA, in that unbroken mirror, was exactly portrayed from<br>
the truck to the waterline, the Jolly Roger hanging from her peak.<br>
<br>
Alongside lay one of the gigs, Silver in the stern-sheets--him I could<br>
always recognize--while a couple of men were leaning over the stern<br>
bulwarks, one of them with a red cap--the very rogue that I had seen<br>
some hours before stride-legs upon the palisade. <span class=GramE>Apparently</span>
they were<br>
talking and laughing, though at that distance--upwards of a mile--I<br>
could, of course, hear no word of what was said. All at once there began<br>
the most horrid, unearthly screaming, which at first startled me badly,<br>
though I had soon remembered the voice of Captain Flint and even thought<br>
I could make out the bird by her bright plumage as she sat perched upon<br>
her master's wrist.<br>
<br>
Soon after, the jolly-boat shoved off and pulled for shore, and the man<br>
with the red cap and his comrade went below by the cabin companion.<br>
<br>
Just about the same time, the sun had gone down behind the Spy-glass,<br>
and as the fog was collecting rapidly, it began to grow dark in earnest.<br>
I saw I must lose no time if I were to find the boat that evening.<br>
<br>
The white rock, visible enough above the brush, was still some eighth of<br>
a mile further down the spit, and it took me a goodish while to get up<br>
with it, crawling, often on all fours, among the scrub. Night had almost<br>
come when I laid my hand on its rough sides. Right below it there was<br>
an exceedingly small hollow of green turf, hidden by banks and a thick<br>
underwood about knee-deep, that grew there very plentifully; and in the<br>
centre of the dell, sure enough, a little tent of goat-skins, like what<br>
the gipsies carry about with them in England.<br>
<br>
I dropped into the hollow, lifted the side of the tent, and there was<br>
Ben Gunn's boat--home-made if ever anything was home-made; a rude,<br>
lop-sided framework of tough wood, and stretched upon that a covering of<br>
goat-skin, with the hair inside. The thing was extremely small, even<br>
for me, and I can hardly imagine that it could have floated with a<br>
full-sized man. There was one thwart set as low as possible, a kind of<br>
stretcher in the bows, and a double paddle for propulsion.<br>
<br>
I had not then seen a coracle, such as the ancient Britons made, but<br>
I have seen one since, and I can give you no fairer idea of Ben Gunn's<br>
boat than by saying it was like the first and the worst coracle ever<br>
made by man. But the great advantage of the coracle it certainly<br>
possessed, for it was exceedingly light and portable.<br>
<br>
Well, now that I had found the boat, you would have thought I had had<br>
enough of truantry for once, but in the meantime I had taken another<br>
notion and become so obstinately fond of it that I would have carried<br>
it out, I believe, in the teeth of Captain Smollett himself. This was<br>
to slip out under cover of the night, cut the HISPANIOLA adrift, and let<br>
her go ashore where she fancied. I had quite made up my mind that the<br>
mutineers, after their repulse of the morning, had nothing nearer their<br>
hearts than to up anchor and away to sea; this, I thought, it would be<br>
a fine thing to prevent, and now that I had seen how they left their<br>
watchmen unprovided with a boat, I thought it might be done with little<br>
risk.<br>
<br>
Down I sat to wait for darkness, and made a hearty meal of biscuit. It<br>
was a night out of ten thousand for my purpose. The fog had now buried<br>
all heaven. As the last rays of daylight dwindled and disappeared,<br>
absolute blackness settled down on Treasure Island. And when, at last,<br>
I shouldered the coracle and groped my way stumblingly out of the hollow<br>
where I had supped, there were but two points visible <span class=GramE>on the
whole</span><br>
anchorage.<br>
<br>
One was the great fire on shore, by which the defeated pirates lay<br>
carousing in the swamp. The other, a mere blur of light upon the<br>
darkness, indicated the position of the anchored ship. She had swung<br>
round to the ebb--her bow was now towards me--the only lights on board<br>
were in the cabin, and what I saw was merely a reflection on the fog of<br>
the strong rays that flowed from the stern window.<br>
<br>
The ebb had already run some time, and I had to wade through a long belt<br>
of swampy sand, where I sank several times above the ankle, before I<br>
came to the edge of the retreating water, and wading a little way in,<br>
with some strength and dexterity, set my coracle, keel downwards, on the<br>
surface.<br>

        <p>1. The outcome of the battle with the mutineers was a victory for the defenders. The mutineers did not return, and the defenders had the place to themselves. Out of the eight men who had fallen in the action, only three remained alive: one of the pirates shot at the loophole, Hunter, and Captain Smollett. Hunter and the pirate were in critical condition and eventually died from their injuries. Captain Smollett, though wounded, was not in grave danger, as his injuries were not fatal. He needed time to recover, during which he was advised not to walk, move his arm, or speak much.</p>
        <p>2. Jim Hawkins began to envy the doctor because he was stuck in the stifling heat of the blockhouse, surrounded by dead bodies and blood, while the doctor enjoyed the cool shade of the woods with birds singing and the pleasant smell of pine trees. Jim felt disgust and envy, which prompted him to plan an escapade. He started by filling his coat pockets with biscuits to ensure he wouldn't starve if he got into trouble. He also armed himself with a brace of pistols, a powder-horn, and bullets. His plan was to venture down the sandy spit to the east coast of the island, find a white rock he had spotted the previous evening, and check if it was where Ben Gunn had hidden his boat. Jim knew this plan was risky, but he was determined to carry it out.</p>
        <p>3. Jim Hawkins' plan, upon finding Ben Gunn's boat, was to slip out under the cover of night, cut the HISPANIOLA adrift, and let it go ashore on its own. He believed that the mutineers, after their repulse earlier in the day, would want to up anchor and sail away, and he wanted to prevent this from happening. Jim was determined to carry out this plan because he thought it would be a way to thwart the mutineers' intentions with little risk, especially since they had left their watchmen without a boat.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>23. The Ebb-tide Runs</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
       <br>
THE coracle--as I had ample reason to know before I was done with<br>
her--was a very safe boat for a person of my height and weight, both<br>
buoyant and clever in a seaway; but she was the most cross-grained,<br>
lop-sided craft to manage. Do as you pleased, she always made more<br>
leeway than anything else, and turning round and round was the manoeuvre<br>
she was best at. Even Ben Gunn himself has admitted that she was &quot;queer<br>
to handle till you knew her way.&quot;<br>
<br>
Certainly I did not know her way. She turned in every direction but the<br>
one I was bound to go; the most part of the time we were broadside on,<br>
and I am very sure I never should have made the ship at all but for the<br>
tide. By good fortune, paddle as I pleased, the tide was still sweeping<br>
me down; and there lay the HISPANIOLA right in the fairway, hardly to be<br>
missed.<br>
<br>
First she loomed before me like a blot of something yet blacker than<br>
darkness, then her spars and hull began to take shape, and the next<br>
moment, as it seemed (for, the farther I went, the brisker grew the<br>
current of the ebb), I was alongside of her hawser and had laid hold.<br>
<br>
The hawser was as taut as a bowstring, and the current so strong she<br>
pulled upon her anchor. All round the hull, in the blackness, the<br>
rippling current bubbled and chattered like a little mountain stream.<br>
One cut with my sea-gully and the HISPANIOLA would go humming down the<br>
tide.<br>
<br>
So far so good, but it next occurred to my recollection that a taut<br>
hawser, suddenly cut, is a thing as dangerous as a kicking horse. Ten to<br>
one, if I were so foolhardy as to cut the HISPANIOLA from her anchor, I<br>
and the coracle would be knocked clean out of the water.<br>
<br>
This brought me to a full stop, and if fortune had not again<br>
particularly favoured me, I should have had to abandon my design. But<br>
the light airs which had begun blowing from the south-east and south<br>
had hauled round after nightfall into the south-west. Just while I was<br>
meditating, a puff came, caught the HISPANIOLA, and forced her up into<br>
the current; and to my great joy, I felt the hawser slacken in my grasp,<br>
and the hand by which I held it dip for a second under water.<br>
<br>
With that I made my mind up, took out my gully, opened it with my teeth,<br>
and cut one strand after another, till the vessel swung only by two.<br>
Then I lay quiet, waiting to sever these last when the strain should be<br>
once more lightened by a breath of wind.<br>
<br>
All this time I had heard the sound of loud voices from the cabin, but<br>
to say truth, my mind had been so entirely taken up with other thoughts<br>
that I had scarcely given ear. Now, however, when I had nothing else to<br>
do, I began to pay more heed.<br>
<br>
One I recognized for the coxswain's, Israel Hands, that had been Flint's<br>
gunner in former days. The other was, of course, my friend of the red<br>
night-cap. Both men were plainly the worse of drink, and they were still<br>
drinking, for even while I was listening, one of them, with a drunken<br>
cry, opened the stern window and threw out something, which I divined to<br>
be an empty bottle. But they were not only tipsy; it was plain that they<br>
were furiously angry. Oaths flew like hailstones, and every now and<br>
then there came forth such an explosion as I thought was sure to end<br>
in blows. But each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled<br>
lower for a while, until the next crisis came <span class=GramE>and in its turn</span>
passed<br>
away without result.<br>
<br>
On shore, I could see the glow of the great camp-fire burning warmly<br>
through the shore-side trees. Someone was singing, a dull, old, droning<br>
sailor's song, with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse,<br>
and seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer. I had<br>
heard it on the voyage more than once and remembered these words:<br>
<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>&quot;But one man of her crew alive,<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>What put to sea with
seventy-five.&quot;<br>
<br>
And I thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate for a<br>
company that had met such cruel losses in the morning. But, indeed, from<br>
what I saw, all these buccaneers were as callous as the sea they sailed<br>
on.<br>
<br>
At last the breeze came; the schooner sidled and drew nearer in the<br>
dark; I felt the hawser slacken once more, and with a good, tough<br>
effort, cut the last fibres through.<br>
<br>
The breeze had but little action on the coracle, and I was almost<br>
instantly swept against the bows of the HISPANIOLA. At the same time,<br>
the schooner began to turn upon her heel, spinning slowly, end for end,<br>
across the current.<br>
<br>
I wrought like a fiend, for I expected every moment to be swamped; and<br>
since I found I could not push the coracle directly off, I now shoved<br>
straight astern. At length I was clear of my dangerous neighbour, and<br>
just as I gave the last impulsion, my hands came across a light cord<br>
that was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks. Instantly I<br>
grasped it.<br>
<br>
Why I should have done so I can hardly say. It was at first mere<br>
instinct, but once I had it in my hands and found it fast, curiosity<br>
began to get the upper hand, and I determined I should have one look<br>
through the cabin window.<br>
<br>
I pulled in hand over hand on the cord, and when I judged myself near<br>
enough, rose at infinite risk to about half my height and thus commanded<br>
the roof and a slice of the interior of the cabin.<br>
<br>
By this time the schooner and her little consort were gliding pretty<br>
swiftly through the water; indeed, we had already fetched up level with<br>
the camp-fire. The ship was talking, as sailors say, loudly, treading<br>
the innumerable ripples with an incessant weltering splash; and until I<br>
got my eye above the <span class=GramE>window-sill</span> I could not
comprehend why the watchmen<br>
had taken no alarm. One glance, however, was sufficient; and it was<br>
only one glance that I durst take from that unsteady skiff. It showed me<br>
Hands and his companion locked together in deadly wrestle, each with a<br>
hand upon the other's throat.<br>
<br>
I dropped upon the thwart again, none too soon, for I was near<br>
overboard. I could see nothing for the moment but these two furious,<br>
encrimsoned faces swaying together under the smoky lamp, and I shut my<br>
eyes to let them grow once more familiar with the darkness.<br>
<br>
The endless ballad had come to an end at last, and the whole diminished<br>
company about the camp-fire had broken into the chorus I had heard so<br>
often:<br>
<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>          </span>&quot;Fifteen men on the dead
man's chest--<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>              </span>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of
rum!<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>           </span>Drink and the devil had done
for the rest--<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>              </span>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of
rum!&quot;<br>
<br>
I was just thinking how busy drink and the devil were at that very<br>
moment in the cabin of the HISPANIOLA, when I was surprised by a sudden<br>
lurch of the coracle. At the same moment, she yawed sharply and seemed<br>
to change her course. The speed in the meantime had strangely increased.<br>
<br>
I opened my eyes at once. All round me were little ripples, combing<br>
over with a sharp, bristling sound and slightly phosphorescent. The<br>
HISPANIOLA herself, a few yards in whose wake I was still being whirled<br>
along, seemed to stagger in her course, and I saw her spars toss a<br>
little against the blackness of the night; nay, as I looked longer, I<br>
made sure she also was wheeling to the southward.<br>
<br>
I glanced over my shoulder, and my heart jumped against my ribs. There,<br>
right behind me, was the glow of the <span class=GramE>camp-fire</span>. The
current had turned<br>
at right angles, sweeping round along with it the tall schooner and<br>
the little dancing coracle; ever quickening, ever bubbling higher, ever<br>
muttering louder, it went spinning through the narrows for the open sea.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the schooner in front of me gave a violent yaw, turning,<br>
perhaps, through twenty degrees; and almost at the same moment one<br>
shout followed another from on board; I could hear feet pounding on<br>
the companion ladder and I knew that the two drunkards had at last been<br>
interrupted in their quarrel and awakened to a sense of their disaster.<br>
<br>
I lay down flat in the bottom of that wretched skiff and devoutly<br>
recommended my spirit to its Maker. At the end of the straits, I<br>
made sure we must fall into some bar of raging breakers, where all my<br>
troubles would be ended speedily; and though I could, perhaps, bear to<br>
die, I could not bear to look upon my fate as it approached.<br>
<br>
So I must have lain for hours, continually beaten to and <span class=SpellE>fro</span>
upon the<br>
billows, now and again wetted with flying sprays, and never ceasing to<br>
expect death at the next plunge. Gradually weariness grew upon me; a<br>
numbness, an occasional stupor, fell upon my mind even <span class=GramE>in the
midst of</span><br>
my terrors, until sleep at last supervened and in my sea-tossed coracle<br>
I lay and dreamed of home and the old Admiral Benbow.<br>

        <p>1. The narrator faced several challenges while trying to approach the HISPANIOLA with the coracle. The coracle was a safe but difficult boat to manage. It had a tendency to make more leeway than desired and was prone to turning round and round. This made it challenging to navigate in the desired direction. Most of the time, they were broadside on to their intended course. However, the narrator was fortunate that the tide was sweeping them down towards the HISPANIOLA. The hawser connecting the coracle to the ship was taut, and the current was strong, making it risky to cut it because the ship might pull them out of the water. The narrator had to wait for a change in the wind to slacken the hawser's tension before cutting it and approaching the ship.</p>
        <p>2. The narrator cut the last fibres of the hawser connecting the coracle to the HISPANIOLA because a breeze had come up, causing the schooner to draw nearer in the dark. This made the hawser slacken once more, and the narrator seized the opportunity to cut it. The fear of being swamped by the approaching ship and the need to separate from it drove the narrator to take this action.</p>
        <p>3. While drifting in the coracle near the HISPANIOLA, a significant event occurs as the ship suddenly yaws (changes its direction) and the current turns at right angles, sweeping both the tall schooner and the small coracle along with it. This change in direction puts them on a new course, rapidly increasing their speed as they move through the narrows toward the open sea. This event dramatically affects the narrator's situation because it separates them from the ship and sends them hurtling through treacherous waters, uncertain of their fate and their ability to survive. It creates a sense of impending danger and uncertainty in the midst of their already precarious situation.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>24. The Cruise of the Coracle</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
IT was broad day when I awoke and found myself tossing at the south-west<br>
end of Treasure Island. The sun was up but was still hid from me behind<br>
the great bulk of the <span class=GramE>Spy-glass</span>, which on this side
descended almost to<br>
the sea in formidable cliffs.<br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE>Haulbowline</span> Head and Mizzen-mast Hill were at my
elbow, the hill bare<br>
and dark, the head bound with cliffs forty or fifty feet high and<br>
fringed with great masses of fallen rock. I was scarce a quarter of a<br>
mile to seaward, and it was my first thought to paddle in and land.<br>
<br>
That notion was soon given over. Among the fallen rocks the breakers<br>
spouted and bellowed; loud reverberations, heavy sprays flying and<br>
falling, succeeded one another from second to second; and I saw myself,<br>
if I ventured nearer, dashed to death upon the rough shore or spending<br>
my strength in vain to scale the beetling crags.<br>
<br>
Nor was that all, for crawling together on flat tables of rock or<br>
letting themselves drop into the sea with loud reports I beheld huge<br>
slimy monsters--soft snails, as it were, of incredible bigness--two<br>
or three score of them together, making the rocks to echo with their<br>
<span class=SpellE>barkings</span>.<br>
<br>
I have understood since that they were sea lions, and entirely harmless.<br>
But the look of them, added to the difficulty of the shore and the<br>
high running of the surf, was more than enough to disgust me of that<br>
landing-place. I felt willing rather to starve at sea than to confront<br>
such perils.<br>
<br>
In the meantime I had a better chance, as I supposed, before me. North<br>
of <span class=SpellE>Haulbowline</span> Head, the land runs in a long way,
leaving at low tide<br>
a long stretch of yellow sand. To the north of that, again, there comes<br>
another cape--<span class=SpellE>Cape</span> of the Woods, as it was marked
upon the chart--buried<br>
in tall green pines, which descended to the margin of the sea.<br>
<br>
I remembered what Silver had said about the current that sets northward<br>
along the whole west coast of Treasure Island, and seeing from my<br>
position that I was already under its influence, I preferred to leave<br>
<span class=SpellE>Haulbowline</span> Head behind me and reserve my strength
for an attempt to<br>
land upon the kindlier-looking Cape of the Woods.<br>
<br>
There was a great, smooth swell upon the sea. The wind blowing steady<br>
and gentle from the south, there was no contrariety between that and the<br>
current, and the billows rose and <span class=GramE>fell</span> unbroken.<br>
<br>
Had it been otherwise, I must long ago have perished; but as it was,<br>
it is surprising how easily and securely my little and light boat could<br>
ride. Often, as I still lay at the bottom and kept no more than an eye<br>
above the gunwale, I would see a big blue summit heaving close above me;<br>
yet the coracle would but bounce a little, dance as if on springs, and<br>
subside on the other side into the trough as lightly as a bird.<br>
<br>
I began after a little to grow very bold and sat up to try my skill at<br>
paddling. But even a small change in the disposition of the weight will<br>
produce violent changes in the behaviour of a coracle. And I had hardly<br>
moved before the boat, giving up at once her gentle dancing movement,<br>
ran straight down a slope of water so steep that it made me giddy, and<br>
struck her nose, with a spout of spray, deep into the side of the next<br>
wave.<br>
<br>
I was drenched and terrified, and fell instantly back into my old<br>
position, whereupon the coracle seemed to find her head again and led<br>
me as softly as before among the billows. It was plain she was not to be<br>
interfered with, and at that rate, since I could in no way influence her<br>
course, what hope had I left of reaching land?<br>
<br>
I began to be horribly frightened, but I kept my head, for all that.<br>
First, moving with all care, I gradually <span class=SpellE>baled</span> out
the coracle with my<br>
sea-cap; then, getting my eye once more above the gunwale, I set myself<br>
to study how it was she managed to slip so quietly through the rollers.<br>
<br>
I found each wave, instead of the big, smooth glossy mountain it looks<br>
from shore or from a vessel's deck, was for all the world like any range<br>
of hills on dry land, full of peaks and smooth places and valleys. The<br>
coracle, left to herself, turning from side to side, threaded, so to<br>
speak, her way through these lower parts and avoided the steep slopes<br>
and higher, toppling summits of the wave.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, now,&quot; thought I to myself, &quot;it is plain I must lie where
I am and<br>
not disturb the balance; but it is plain also that I can put the paddle<br>
over the side and from time to time, in smooth places, give her a shove<br>
or two towards land.&quot; No sooner thought upon than done. There I lay on<br>
my elbows in the most trying attitude, and every now and again gave a<br>
weak stroke or two to turn her head to shore.<br>
<br>
It was very tiring and slow work, yet I did visibly gain ground; and as<br>
we drew near the Cape of the Woods, though I saw I must infallibly<br>
miss that point, I had still made some hundred yards of easting. I was,<br>
indeed, close in. I could see the cool green tree-tops swaying together<br>
in the breeze, and I felt sure I should make the next promontory without<br>
fail.<br>
<br>
It was high time, for I now began to be tortured with thirst. The glow<br>
of the sun from above, its thousandfold reflection from the waves, the<br>
<span class=GramE>sea-water</span> that fell and dried upon me, caking my very
lips with salt,<br>
combined to make my throat burn and my brain ache. The sight of the<br>
trees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing, but the<br>
current had soon carried me past the point, and as the next reach of sea<br>
opened out, I beheld a sight that changed the nature of my thoughts.<br>
<br>
Right in front of me, not half a mile away, I beheld the HISPANIOLA<br>
under sail. I made sure, of course, that I should be taken; but I was<br>
so distressed for want of water that I scarce knew whether to be glad<br>
or sorry at the thought, and long before I had come to a conclusion,<br>
surprise had taken entire possession of my mind and I could do nothing<br>
but stare and wonder.<br>
<br>
The HISPANIOLA was under her main-sail and two jibs, and the beautiful<br>
white canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver. When I first<br>
sighted her, all her sails were drawing; she was lying a course about<br>
north-west, and I presumed the men on board were going round the island<br>
on their way back to the anchorage. Presently she began to fetch more<br>
and more to the westward, so that I thought they had sighted me and were<br>
going about in chase. At last, however, she fell right into the wind's<br>
eye, was taken dead aback, and stood there awhile helpless, with her<br>
sails shivering.<br>
<br>
&quot;Clumsy fellows,&quot; said I; &quot;they must still be drunk as
owls.&quot; And I<br>
thought how Captain Smollett would have set them skipping.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile the schooner gradually fell off and filled again upon another<br>
tack, sailed swiftly for a minute or so, and brought up once more dead<br>
in the wind's eye. <span class=GramE>Again</span> and again was this repeated.
To and <span class=SpellE>fro</span>, up and<br>
down, north, south, east, and west, the HISPANIOLA sailed by swoops<br>
and dashes, and at each repetition ended as she had begun, with idly<br>
flapping canvas. It became plain to me that nobody was steering. And if<br>
so, where were the men? Either they were dead drunk or had deserted her,<br>
I thought, and perhaps if I could get on board I might return the vessel<br>
to her captain.<br>
<br>
The current was bearing coracle and schooner southward at an equal rate.<br>
As for the latter's sailing, it was so wild and intermittent, and she<br>
hung each time so long in irons, that she certainly gained nothing, if<br>
she did not even lose. If only I dared to sit up and paddle, I made<br>
sure that I could overhaul her. The scheme had an air of adventure<br>
that inspired me, and the thought of the water breaker beside the fore<br>
companion doubled my growing courage.<br>
<br>
Up I got, was welcomed almost instantly by another cloud of spray, but<br>
this time stuck to my purpose and set myself, with all my strength and<br>
caution, to paddle after the unsteered HISPANIOLA. Once I shipped a sea<br>
so heavy that I had to stop and bail, with my heart fluttering like<br>
a bird, but gradually I got into the way of the thing and guided my<br>
coracle among the waves, with only now and then a blow upon her bows and<br>
a dash of foam in my face.<br>
<br>
I was now gaining rapidly on the schooner; I could see the brass glisten<br>
on the tiller as it banged about, and still no soul appeared upon her<br>
decks. I could not choose but suppose she was deserted. If not, the men<br>
were lying drunk below, where I might batten them down, perhaps, and do<br>
what I chose with the ship.<br>
<br>
For some time she had been doing the worse thing possible for<br>
me--standing still. She headed nearly due south, yawing, of course, all<br>
the time. Each time she fell off, her sails partly filled, and these<br>
brought her in a moment right to the wind again. I have said this was<br>
the worst thing possible for me, for helpless as she looked in this<br>
situation, with the canvas cracking like cannon and the blocks trundling<br>
and banging on the deck, she still continued to run away from me, not<br>
only with the speed of the current, but by the whole amount of her<br>
leeway, which was naturally great.<br>
<br>
But now, at last, I had my chance. The breeze fell for some seconds,<br>
very low, and the current gradually turning her, the HISPANIOLA revolved<br>
slowly round her centre and at last presented me her stern, with the<br>
cabin window still gaping open and the lamp over the table still burning<br>
on into the day. The <span class=GramE>main-sail</span> hung drooped like a
banner. She was<br>
stock-still but for the current.<br>
<br>
For the last little while I had even lost, but now redoubling my<br>
efforts, I began once more to overhaul the chase.<br>
<br>
I was not a hundred yards from her when the wind came again in a clap;<br>
she filled on the port tack and was off again, stooping and skimming<br>
like a swallow.<br>
<br>
My first impulse was one of despair, but my second was towards joy.<br>
Round she came, till she was broadside on to me--round still till she<br>
had covered a half and then two thirds and then three quarters of the<br>
distance that separated us. I could see the waves boiling white under<br>
her forefoot. Immensely tall she looked to me from my low station in the<br>
coracle.<br>
<br>
And then, of a sudden, I began to comprehend. I had scarce time to<br>
think--scarce time to act and save myself. I was on the summit of one<br>
swell when the schooner came stooping over the next. The bowsprit was<br>
over my head. I sprang to my feet and leaped, stamping the coracle under<br>
water. With one hand I caught the jib-boom, while my foot was lodged<br>
between the stay and the brace; and as I still clung there panting, a<br>
dull blow told me that the schooner had charged down upon and struck the<br>
coracle and that I was left without retreat on the HISPANIOLA.<br>

        <p>1. When the narrator awoke near the south-west end of Treasure Island, their initial thought was to paddle in and land. However, they quickly abandoned this idea because the shore was treacherous, with formidable cliffs, fallen rocks, and dangerous breakers. The narrator realized that attempting to land in these conditions would likely result in their death or injury. Additionally, the presence of huge sea lions on the rocks further discouraged them from attempting to land at that particular location. Instead, they chose to continue northward, hoping to find a safer and more favorable landing spot on the Cape of the Woods.</p>
        <p>2. The narrator attempted to navigate the coracle through the waves by carefully observing the characteristics of the waves themselves. They noticed that the waves, when viewed up close, resembled ranges of hills on dry land, with peaks, smooth areas, and valleys. The coracle, when left to itself, naturally moved through the lower parts of the waves and avoided the steeper slopes and higher summits.</p>
        <p>To help guide the coracle toward land, the narrator lay on their elbows, trying not to disturb the balance of the boat. They used a paddle to give the coracle a shove in the right direction whenever they encountered a smooth part of a wave. While this method was slow and tiring, it allowed the narrator to make progress toward their goal.</p>
        <p>The challenges they faced included the physical exertion of paddling from an uncomfortable position and the slow progress they were making. Additionally, the narrator was becoming increasingly thirsty, with the sun's heat and saltwater exacerbating their discomfort. Despite these challenges, they remained determined to reach land and continued their efforts.</p>
        <p>3. The narrator's decision to sit up and paddle after the unsteered HISPANIOLA allowed them to gain rapidly on the schooner. Initially, the schooner had been heading nearly due south, making it difficult for the narrator to catch up. However, as the current gradually turned the HISPANIOLA, it presented its stern to the narrator, creating an opportunity for them to catch up.</p>
        <p>As the HISPANIOLA revolved slowly, its stern facing the narrator, they managed to close the distance. But just when they were about a hundred yards away, the wind suddenly came back, and the schooner filled its sails and started moving again. Initially, this development led to despair for the narrator. However, the schooner came broadside to them, and the narrator realized they had a chance. They made a daring leap, catching hold of the jib-boom, and as a result of a collision between the coracle and the schooner, they found themselves stranded on the HISPANIOLA.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>25. I Strike the Jolly Roger</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
I HAD scarce gained a position on the bowsprit when the flying jib<br>
flapped and filled upon the other tack, with a report like a gun. The<br>
schooner trembled to her keel under the reverse, but next moment, the<br>
other sails still drawing, the jib flapped back again and hung idle.<br>
<br>
This had nearly tossed me off into the sea; and now I lost no time,<br>
crawled back along the bowsprit, and tumbled head foremost on the deck.<br>
<br>
I was on the lee side of the forecastle, and the mainsail, which was<br>
still drawing, concealed from me a certain portion of the after-deck.<br>
Not a soul was to be seen. The planks, which had not been swabbed since<br>
the mutiny, bore the print of many feet, and an empty bottle, broken by<br>
the neck, tumbled to and <span class=SpellE>fro</span> like a live thing in the
scuppers.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the HISPANIOLA came right into the wind. The jibs behind me<br>
cracked aloud, the rudder slammed to, the whole ship gave a sickening<br>
heave and shudder, and at the same moment the main-boom swung inboard,<br>
the sheet groaning in the blocks, and showed me the lee after-deck.<br>
<br>
There were the two watchmen, sure enough: red-cap on his back, as stiff<br>
as a handspike, with his arms stretched out like those of a crucifix and<br>
his teeth showing through his open lips; Israel Hands propped against<br>
the bulwarks, his chin on his chest, his hands lying open before him on<br>
the deck, his face as white, under its tan, as a tallow candle.<br>
<br>
For a while the ship kept bucking and sidling like a vicious horse, the<br>
sails filling, now on one tack, now on another, and the boom swinging to<br>
and <span class=SpellE>fro</span> till the mast groaned aloud under the strain.
Now and again too<br>
there would come a cloud of light sprays over the bulwark and a heavy<br>
blow of the ship's bows against the swell; so much heavier weather was<br>
made of it by this great rigged ship than by my home-made, lop-sided<br>
coracle, now gone to the bottom of the sea.<br>
<br>
At every jump of the schooner, red-cap slipped to and <span class=SpellE>fro</span>,
but--what was<br>
ghastly to behold--neither his attitude nor his fixed teeth-disclosing<br>
grin was anyway disturbed by this rough usage. At every jump too, Hands<br>
appeared still more to sink into himself and settle down upon the<br>
deck, his feet sliding ever the farther out, and the whole body canting<br>
towards the stern, so that his face became, little by little, hid<br>
from me; and at last I could see nothing beyond his ear and the frayed<br>
ringlet of one whisker.<br>
<br>
At the same time, I observed, around both of them, splashes of dark<br>
blood upon the planks and began to feel sure that they had killed each<br>
other in their drunken wrath.<br>
<br>
While I was thus looking and wondering, in a calm moment, when the ship<br>
was still, Israel Hands turned partly round and with a low moan writhed<br>
himself back to the position in which I had seen him first. The moan,<br>
which told of pain and deadly weakness, and the way in which his jaw<br>
hung open went right to my heart. But when I remembered the <span class=GramE>talk</span>
I had<br>
overheard from the apple barrel, all pity left me.<br>
<br>
I walked aft until I reached the main-mast.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come aboard, Mr. Hands,&quot; I said ironically.<br>
<br>
He rolled his eyes round heavily, but he was too far gone to express<br>
surprise. All he could do was to utter one word, &quot;Brandy.&quot;<br>
<br>
It occurred to me there was no time to <span class=GramE>lose, and</span>
dodging the boom as it<br>
once more lurched across the deck, I slipped aft and down the companion<br>
stairs into the cabin.<br>
<br>
It was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy. All the<br>
<span class=SpellE>lockfast</span> places had been broken open in quest of the
chart. The floor<br>
was thick with mud where ruffians had sat down to drink or consult after<br>
wading in the marshes round their camp. The bulkheads, all painted in<br>
clear white and beaded round with gilt, bore a pattern of dirty hands.<br>
Dozens of empty bottles clinked together in corners to the rolling of<br>
the ship. One of the doctor's medical books lay open on the table, half<br>
of the leaves gutted out, I suppose, for <span class=SpellE>pipelights</span>. <span
class=GramE>In the midst of</span> all<br>
this the lamp still cast a smoky glow, obscure and brown as umber.<br>
<br>
I went into the cellar; all the barrels were gone, and of the bottles<br>
a most surprising number had been drunk out and thrown away. Certainly,<br>
since the mutiny began, not a man of them could ever have been sober.<br>
<br>
Foraging about, I found a bottle with some brandy left, for Hands; and<br>
for myself I routed out some biscuit, some pickled fruits, a great bunch<br>
of raisins, and a piece of cheese. With these I came on deck, put down<br>
my own stock behind the rudder head and well out of the coxswain's<br>
reach, went forward to the water-breaker, and had a good deep drink of<br>
water, and then, and not till then, gave Hands the brandy.<br>
<br>
He must have drunk a gill before he took the bottle from his mouth.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye,&quot; said he, &quot;by thunder, but I wanted some o' that!&quot;<br>
<br>
I had sat down already in my own corner and begun to eat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Much hurt?&quot; I asked him.<br>
<br>
He grunted, or rather, I might say, he barked.<br>
<br>
&quot;If that doctor was aboard,&quot; he said, &quot;I'd be right enough in a
couple<br>
of turns, but I don't have no manner of luck, you see, and that's what's<br>
the matter with me. As for that swab, he's good and dead, he is,&quot; he<br>
added, indicating the man with the red cap. &quot;He <span class=SpellE>warn't</span>
no seaman anyhow.<br>
And where <span class=SpellE>mought</span> you have come from?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; said I, &quot;I've come aboard to take possession of this
ship,<br>
Mr. Hands; and you'll please regard me as your captain until further<br>
notice.&quot;<br>
<br>
He looked at me sourly enough but said nothing. Some of the colour had<br>
come back into his cheeks, though he still looked very sick and still<br>
continued to slip out and settle down as the ship banged about.<br>
<br>
&quot;By the by,&quot; I continued, &quot;I can't have these colours, Mr.
Hands; and by<br>
your leave, I'll strike '<span class=SpellE>em</span>. Better none than
these.&quot;<br>
<br>
And again dodging the boom, I ran to the colour lines, handed down their<br>
cursed black flag, and chucked it overboard.<br>
<br>
&quot;God save the king!&quot; said I, waving my cap. &quot;And there's an end
to<br>
Captain Silver!&quot;<br>
<br>
He watched me keenly and slyly, his chin all the while on his breast.<br>
<br>
&quot;I reckon,&quot; he said at last, &quot;I reckon, <span class=SpellE>Cap'n</span>
Hawkins, you'll kind of<br>
want to get ashore now. <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>S'pose</span></span>
we talks.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, yes,&quot; says I, &quot;with all my heart, Mr. Hands. Say on.&quot;
And I went<br>
back to my meal with a good appetite.<br>
<br>
&quot;This man,&quot; he began, nodding feebly at the corpse &quot;--O'Brien
were his<br>
name, a rank Irelander--this man and me got the canvas on her, meaning<br>
for to sail her back. Well, HE'S dead now, he is--as dead as bilge; and<br>
who's to sail this ship, I don't see. Without I gives you a hint, you<br>
<span class=SpellE>ain't</span> that man, as <span class=SpellE>far's</span> I
can tell. Now, look here, you <span class=GramE>gives</span> me food<br>
and drink and <span class=SpellE>a</span> old scarf or <span class=SpellE>ankecher</span>
to tie my wound up, you do, and<br>
I'll tell you how to sail her, and that's about square all round, I take<br>
it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll tell you one thing,&quot; says I: &quot;I'm not going back to
Captain Kidd's<br>
anchorage. I mean to get into North Inlet and beach her quietly there.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;To be sure you did,&quot; he cried. &quot;Why, I <span class=SpellE>ain't</span>
<span class=SpellE>sich</span> an infernal lubber<br>
after all. I can see, can't I? I've tried my fling, I have, and I've<br>
lost, and it's you <span class=GramE>has</span> the wind of me. North Inlet?
Why, I haven't no<br>
<span class=SpellE>ch'ice</span>, not I! I'd help you sail her up to Execution
Dock, by thunder!<br>
So I would.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, as it seemed to me, there was some sense in this. We struck our<br>
bargain on the spot. In three minutes I had the HISPANIOLA sailing<br>
easily before the wind along the coast of Treasure Island, with good<br>
hopes of turning the northern point ere noon and beating down again as<br>
far as North Inlet before high water, when we might beach her safely and<br>
wait till the subsiding tide permitted us to land.<br>
<br>
Then I lashed the tiller and went below to my own chest, where I got a<br>
soft silk handkerchief of my mother's. With this, and with my aid, Hands<br>
bound up the great bleeding stab he had received in the thigh, and after<br>
he had eaten a little and had a swallow or two more of the brandy, he<br>
began to pick up visibly, sat straighter up, spoke louder and clearer,<br>
and looked in every way another man.<br>
<br>
The breeze served us admirably. We skimmed before it like a bird, the<br>
coast of the island flashing by and the view changing every minute.<br>
Soon we were past the high lands and bowling beside low, sandy country,<br>
sparsely dotted with dwarf pines, and soon we were beyond that again<br>
and had turned the corner of the rocky hill that ends the island on the<br>
north.<br>
<br>
I was greatly elated with my new command, and pleased with the bright,<br>
sunshiny weather and these different prospects of the coast. I had now<br>
plenty of water and good things to eat, and my conscience, which had<br>
smitten me hard for my desertion, was quieted by the great conquest I<br>
had made. I should, I think, have had nothing left me to desire but for<br>
the eyes of the coxswain as they followed me derisively about the deck<br>
and the odd smile that appeared continually on his face. It was a smile<br>
that had in it something both of pain and weakness--a haggard old man's<br>
smile; but there was, besides that, a grain of derision, a shadow of<br>
treachery, in his expression as he craftily watched, and watched, and<br>
watched me at my work.<br>

        <p>1. When the narrator saw Red-cap and Israel Hands on the after-deck of the HISPANIOLA, both men were in a lifeless and eerie state. Red-cap lay on his back with his arms stretched out like a crucifix, his teeth showing through his open lips, and he appeared stiff and unmoving. Israel Hands was propped against the bulwarks, with his chin on his chest and his hands lying open before him on the deck. His face was unnaturally white beneath his tan, and he displayed no signs of life. Both men seemed to be in a ghastly and motionless condition, despite the ship's violent movements.</p>
        <p>2. In this text, the ship's cabin is depicted as a scene of chaos and disarray. The lockfast places have been broken open in search of a chart, the floor is covered in mud from ruffians who had been drinking and consulting, the bulkheads are marked with dirty handprints, empty bottles are scattered about, and one of the doctor's medical books has been gutted for use as pipelights. Despite the disorder, a smoky lamp still provides dim illumination. The ship's crew members, particularly Mr. Hands, are in poor condition. Mr. Hands, in particular, appears sick and intoxicated, while some crew members are dead. The overall state of the ship and its crew reflects the chaos and lawlessness resulting from a mutiny.</p>
        <p>3. The protagonist (presumably Jim Hawkins), Mr. Hands, and the coxswain negotiate a plan for sailing the ship. Mr. Hands, who is injured and in need of assistance, proposes a deal where he offers to share information on how to sail the ship in exchange for food, drink, and a scarf or handkerchief to bind his wound. Jim agrees to the deal, and they quickly strike an agreement. As a result, Jim and Mr. Hands work together to sail the Hispaniola to North Inlet on Treasure Island. The negotiation and agreement play a crucial role in determining their course of action, as they plan to beach the ship safely and wait for the subsiding tide to allow them to land. This collaboration sets the stage for their journey and adventure on Treasure Island.</p>

<br>
THE wind, serving us to a desire, now hauled into the west. We could run<br>
so much the easier from the north-east corner of the island to the mouth<br>
of the North Inlet. Only, as we had no power to anchor and dared not<br>
beach her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther, time hung on our<br>
hands. The coxswain told me how to lay the ship to; after a good many<br>
trials I succeeded, and we both sat in silence over another meal.<br>
<br>
&quot;<span class=SpellE>Cap'n</span>,&quot; said he at length with that same
uncomfortable smile, &quot;here's<br>
my old shipmate, O'Brien; <span class=SpellE>s'pose</span> you <span
class=GramE>was</span> to <span class=SpellE>heave</span> him overboard. I <span
class=SpellE>ain't</span><br>
<span class=SpellE>partic'lar</span> as a rule, and I don't take no blame for
settling his hash,<br>
but I don't reckon him ornamental now, do you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not strong enough, and I don't like the job; and there he lies, for<br>
me,&quot; said I.<br>
<br>
&quot;This here's an unlucky ship, this HISPANIOLA, Jim,&quot; he went on,<br>
blinking. &quot;There's a power of men been killed in this HISPANIOLA--a<br>
sight o' poor seamen dead and gone since you and me took ship to<br>
Bristol. I never seen <span class=SpellE>sich</span> dirty luck, not I. There
was this here<br>
O'Brien now--he's dead, <span class=SpellE>ain't</span> he? Well now, I'm no
scholar, and you're a<br>
lad as can read and figure, and to put it straight, do you take it as a<br>
dead man is dead for good, or do he come alive again?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You can kill the body, Mr. Hands, but not the spirit; you must know<br>
that already,&quot; I replied. &quot;O'Brien there is in another <span
class=GramE>world, and</span> may be<br>
watching us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah!&quot; says he. &quot;Well, that's <span class=SpellE>unfort'nate</span>--appears
as if killing parties<br>
was a waste of time. Howsomever, <span class=SpellE>sperrits</span> don't
reckon for much, by what<br>
I've seen. I'll chance it with the <span class=SpellE>sperrits</span>, Jim. And
now, you've spoke<br>
up free, and I'll take it kind if you'd step down into that <span class=GramE>there</span>
cabin<br>
and get me a--well, a--shiver my timbers! I can't hit the name on 't;<br>
well, you get me a bottle of wine, Jim--this here brandy's too strong<br>
for my head.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, the coxswain's hesitation seemed to be unnatural, and as for the<br>
notion of his preferring wine to brandy, I entirely disbelieved it. The<br>
whole story was a pretext. He wanted me to leave the deck--so much was<br>
plain; but with what purpose I could in no way imagine. His eyes never<br>
met mine; they kept wandering to and <span class=SpellE>fro</span>, <span
class=GramE>up</span> and down, now with a look<br>
to the sky, now with a flitting glance upon the dead O'Brien. All the<br>
time he kept smiling and putting his tongue out in the <span class=GramE>most
guilty</span>,<br>
embarrassed manner, so that a child could have told that he was bent on<br>
some deception. I was prompt with my answer, however, for I saw where<br>
my advantage lay and that with a fellow so densely stupid I could easily<br>
conceal my suspicions to the end.<br>
<br>
&quot;Some wine?&quot; I <span class=GramE>said</span>. &quot;Far better. Will
you have white or red?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I reckon it's about the blessed same to me, shipmate,&quot; he<br>
replied; &quot;so it's strong, and plenty of it, what's the odds?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;All right,&quot; I answered. &quot;I'll bring you port, Mr. Hands. But
I'll have<br>
to dig for it.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that I scuttled down the companion with all the noise I could,<br>
slipped off my shoes, ran quietly along the sparred gallery, mounted the<br>
forecastle ladder, and popped my head out of the fore companion. I<br>
knew he would not expect to see me there, yet I took every precaution<br>
possible, and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true.<br>
<br>
He had risen from his position to his hands and knees, and though his<br>
leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he moved--for I could hear<br>
him stifle a groan--yet it was at a good, rattling rate that he trailed<br>
himself across the deck. In half a minute he had reached the port<br>
scuppers and picked, out of a coil of rope, a long knife, or rather a<br>
short dirk, discoloured to the hilt with blood. He looked upon it for<br>
a moment, thrusting forth his under jaw, tried the point upon his hand,<br>
and then, hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket, trundled<br>
back again into his old place against the bulwark.<br>
<br>
This was all that I required to know. Israel could move about, he was<br>
now armed, and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me,<br>
it was plain that I was meant to be the victim. What he would do<br>
afterwards--whether he would try to crawl right across the island from<br>
North Inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire Long<br>
Tom, trusting that his own comrades might come first to help him--was,<br>
of course, more than I could say.<br>
<br>
Yet I felt sure that I could trust him in one point, since in that<br>
our interests jumped together, and that was in the disposition of<br>
the schooner. We both desired to have her stranded safe enough, in a<br>
sheltered place, and so that, when the time came, she could be got off<br>
again with as little labour and danger as might be; and until that was<br>
done I considered that my life would certainly be spared.<br>
<br>
While I was thus turning the business over in my mind, I had not been<br>
idle with my body. I had stolen back to the cabin, slipped once more<br>
into my shoes, and laid my hand at random on a bottle of wine, and now,<br>
with this for an excuse, I made my reappearance on the deck.<br>
<br>
Hands lay as I had left him, all fallen together in a bundle and with<br>
his eyelids lowered as though he were too weak to bear the light. He<br>
looked up, however, at my coming, knocked the neck off the bottle like<br>
a man who had done the same thing often, and took a good swig, with his<br>
favourite toast of &quot;Here's luck!&quot; Then he lay quiet for a little, and<br>
then, pulling out a stick of tobacco, begged me to cut him a quid.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cut me a junk o' that,&quot; says he, &quot;for I haven't no knife and
hardly<br>
strength enough, so be as I had. Ah, Jim, Jim, I reckon I've missed<br>
stays! Cut me a quid, <span class=SpellE>as'll</span> likely be the last, lad,
for I'm for my long<br>
home, and no mistake.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; said I, &quot;I'll cut you some tobacco, but if I was you and
thought<br>
myself so badly, I would go to my prayers like a Christian man.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why?&quot; said he. &quot;Now, you tell me why.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why?&quot; I cried. &quot;You were asking me just now about the dead.
You've<br>
broken your trust; you've lived in sin and lies and blood; there's a man<br>
you killed lying at your feet this moment, and you ask me why! For God's<br>
mercy, Mr. Hands, that's why.&quot;<br>
<br>
I spoke with a little heat, thinking of the bloody dirk he had hidden<br>
in his pocket and designed, in his ill thoughts, to end me with. He,<br>
for his part, took a great draught of the wine and spoke with the most<br>
unusual solemnity.<br>
<br>
&quot;For thirty years,&quot; he said, &quot;I've sailed the seas and seen good
and<br>
bad, better and worse, fair weather and foul, provisions running out,<br>
knives going, and what not. Well, now I tell you, I never seen good come<br>
o' goodness yet. Him as strikes first is my fancy; dead men don't bite;<br>
<span class=SpellE>them's</span> my views--amen, so be it. And now, you look
here,&quot; he added,<br>
suddenly changing his tone, &quot;we've had about enough of this foolery. The<br>
<span class=GramE>tide's</span> made good enough by now. You just take my
orders, <span class=SpellE>Cap'n</span> Hawkins,<br>
and we'll sail slap in and be done with it.&quot;<br>
<br>
All told, we had scarce two miles to run; but the navigation was<br>
delicate, the entrance to this northern anchorage was not only narrow<br>
and shoal, but lay east and west, so that the schooner must be nicely<br>
handled to be got in. I think I was a good, prompt subaltern, and I am<br>
very sure that Hands was an excellent pilot, for we went about and about<br>
and dodged in, shaving the banks, with a certainty and a neatness that<br>
were a pleasure to behold.<br>
<br>
Scarcely had we passed the heads before the land closed around us. The<br>
shores of North Inlet were as thickly wooded as those of the southern<br>
anchorage, but the space was longer and narrower and more like, what in<br>
truth it was, the estuary of a river. Right before us, at the southern<br>
end, we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stages of dilapidation. It<br>
had been a great vessel of three masts but had lain so long exposed to<br>
the injuries of the weather that it was hung about with great webs of<br>
dripping seaweed, and on the deck of it shore bushes had taken root and<br>
now flourished thick with flowers. It was a sad sight, but it showed us<br>
that the anchorage was calm.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now,&quot; said Hands, &quot;look there; there's a pet bit for to beach a
ship<br>
in. Fine flat sand, never a cat's paw, trees <span class=SpellE>all around</span>
of it, and<br>
flowers a-blowing like a <span class=SpellE>garding</span> on that old
ship.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And once beached,&quot; I inquired, &quot;how shall we get her off
again?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, so,&quot; he replied: &quot;you take a line ashore there on the
other side<br>
at low water, take a turn about one of them big pines; bring it back,<br>
take a turn around the capstan, and lie to for the tide. Come high<br>
water, all hands take a pull upon the line, and off she comes as sweet<br>
as <span class=SpellE>natur</span>'. And now, boy, you stand by. We're near the
bit now, and she's<br>
too much way on her. Starboard a little--so--steady--starboard--larboard<br>
a little--steady--<span class=SpellE>steady</span>!&quot;<br>
<br>
So he issued his commands, which I breathlessly obeyed, till, <span
class=GramE>all of</span> a<br>
sudden, he cried, &quot;Now, my hearty, luff!&quot; And I put the helm hard up,<br>
and the HISPANIOLA swung round rapidly and ran stem on for the low,<br>
wooded shore.<br>
<br>
The excitement of these last manoeuvres had somewhat interfered with the<br>
watch I had kept hitherto, sharply enough, upon the coxswain. Even then<br>
I was still so much interested, waiting for the ship to touch, that I<br>
had quite forgot the peril that hung over my head and stood craning over<br>
the starboard bulwarks and watching the ripples spreading wide before<br>
the bows. I might have fallen without a struggle for my life had not a<br>
sudden disquietude seized upon me and made me turn my head. Perhaps I<br>
had heard a creak or seen his shadow moving with the tail of my eye;<br>
perhaps it was an instinct like a cat's; but, sure enough, when I looked<br>
round, there was Hands, already half-way towards me, with the dirk in<br>
his right hand.<br>
<br>
We must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met, but while mine<br>
was the shrill cry of terror, his was a roar of fury like a charging<br>
bully's. At the same instant, he threw himself forward and I leapt<br>
sideways towards the bows. As I did so, I let go of the tiller, which<br>
sprang sharp to leeward, and I think this saved my life, for it struck<br>
Hands across the chest and stopped him, for the moment, dead.<br>
<br>
Before he could recover, I was safe out of the corner where he had me<br>
trapped, with all the deck to dodge about. Just forward of the <span
class=GramE>main-mast</span><br>
I stopped, drew a pistol from my pocket, took a cool aim, though he had<br>
already turned and was once more coming directly after me, and drew the<br>
trigger. The hammer fell, but there followed neither flash nor sound;<br>
the priming was useless with <span class=GramE>sea-water</span>. I cursed
myself for my neglect.<br>
Why had not I, long before, reprimed and reloaded my only weapons? Then<br>
I should not have been as now, a mere fleeing sheep before this butcher.<br>
<br>
Wounded as he was, it was wonderful how fast he could move, his grizzled<br>
hair tumbling over his face, and his face itself as red as a red ensign<br>
with his haste and fury. I had no time to try my other pistol, nor<br>
indeed much inclination, for I was sure it would be useless. One thing I<br>
saw plainly: I must not simply retreat before him, or he would speedily<br>
hold me boxed into the bows, as a moment since he had so nearly boxed<br>
me in the stern. Once so caught, and nine or ten inches of the<br>
blood-stained dirk would be my last experience on this side of eternity.<br>
I placed my palms against the main-mast, which was of a goodish bigness,<br>
and waited, every nerve upon the stretch.<br>
<br>
Seeing that I meant to dodge, he also paused; and a moment or two passed<br>
in feints on his part and corresponding movements upon mine. It was such<br>
a game as I had often played at home about the rocks of Black Hill Cove,<br>
but <span class=GramE>never before</span>, you may be sure, with such a wildly
beating heart as<br>
now. Still, as I say, it was a boy's game, and I thought I could hold<br>
my own at it against an elderly seaman with a wounded thigh. Indeed my<br>
courage had begun to rise so high that I allowed myself a few darting<br>
thoughts on what would be the end of the affair, and while I saw<br>
certainly that I could spin it out for long, I saw no hope of any<br>
ultimate escape.<br>
<br>
Well, while things stood thus, suddenly the HISPANIOLA struck,<br>
staggered, ground for an instant in the sand, and then, swift as a<br>
blow, canted over to the port side till the deck stood at an angle<br>
of forty-five degrees and about a puncheon of water splashed into the<br>
scupper holes and lay, in a pool, between the deck and bulwark.<br>
<br>
We were both of us capsized in a second, and both of us rolled, almost<br>
together, into the scuppers, the dead red-cap, with his arms still<br>
spread out, tumbling stiffly after us. So near were we, indeed, that my<br>
head came against the coxswain's foot with a crack that made my teeth<br>
rattle. Blow and all, I was the first afoot again, for Hands had got<br>
involved with the dead body. The sudden canting of the ship had made the<br>
deck no place for running on; I had to find some new way of escape,<br>
and that upon the instant, for my foe was almost touching me. Quick as<br>
thought, I sprang into the mizzen shrouds, rattled up hand over hand,<br>
and did not draw a breath till I was seated on the cross-trees.<br>
<br>
I had been saved by being prompt; the dirk had struck not half a foot<br>
below me as I pursued my upward flight; and there stood Israel Hands<br>
with his mouth open and his face upturned to mine, a perfect statue of<br>
surprise and disappointment.<br>
<br>
Now that I had a moment to myself, I lost no time in changing the<br>
priming of my pistol, and then, having one ready for service, and to<br>
make assurance doubly sure, I proceeded to draw the load of the other<br>
and recharge it afresh from the beginning.<br>
<br>
My new employment struck Hands all of a heap; he began to see the dice<br>
going against him, and after an obvious hesitation, he also hauled<br>
himself heavily into the shrouds, and with the dirk in his teeth, began<br>
slowly and painfully to mount. It cost him no end of time and groans<br>
to haul his wounded leg behind him, and I had quietly finished my<br>
arrangements before he was much more than a third of the way up. Then,<br>
with a pistol in either hand, I addressed him.<br>
<br>
&quot;One more step, Mr. Hands,&quot; said I, &quot;and I'll blow your brains
out! Dead<br>
men don't bite, you know,&quot; I added with a chuckle.<br>
<br>
He stopped instantly. I could see by the working of his face that he was<br>
trying to think, and the process was so slow and laborious that, in my<br>
new-found security, I laughed aloud. At last, with a swallow or two, he<br>
spoke, his face still wearing the same expression of extreme perplexity.<br>
<span class=GramE>In order to</span> speak he had to take the dagger from his
mouth, but in all<br>
else he remained unmoved.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jim,&quot; says he, &quot;I reckon we're fouled, you and me, and we'll
have to<br>
sign articles. I'd have had you but for that there lurch, but I don't<br>
have no luck, not I; and I reckon I'll have to strike, which comes hard,<br>
you see, for a master mariner to a ship's younker like you, Jim.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was drinking in his words and smiling away, as conceited as a cock<br>
upon a wall, when, all in a breath, back went his right hand over his<br>
shoulder. Something sang like an arrow through the air; I felt a blow<br>
and then a sharp pang, and there I was pinned by the shoulder to the<br>
mast. In the horrid pain and surprise of the moment--I scarce can say<br>
it was by my own volition, and I am sure it was without a conscious<br>
aim--both my pistols went off, and both escaped out of my hands. They<br>
did not fall alone; with a choked cry, the coxswain <span class=GramE>loosed</span>
his grasp<br>
upon the shrouds and plunged head first into the water.<br>

        <p>1. The coxswain, Mr. Hands, asked Jim to fetch him a bottle of wine from the cabin as a pretext to get Jim away from the deck. Mr. Hands had ulterior motives and did not actually prefer wine over brandy. Jim sensed that Mr. Hands wanted him to leave the deck for some undisclosed purpose. When Jim went to retrieve the wine from the cabin, he discovered that Mr. Hands was planning treachery or deception. The text does not explicitly reveal Mr. Hands' intentions at this point, but it is clear from his behavior and Jim's suspicions that he was up to something suspicious and potentially harmful.</p>
        <p>2. Jim reacts to Mr. Hands' threat and the imminent danger posed by the drawn dirk with a combination of instinct and quick thinking. When Jim detects Mr. Hands approaching him with the dirk, he doesn't panic. Instead, he trusts his instincts and turns his head just in time to see the threat. This quick reaction allows Jim to avoid a surprise attack. Following this, Jim's response is not explicitly mentioned in this particular passage, but his earlier mention of Mr. Hands having a "bloody dirk" hidden in his pocket suggests that Jim is aware of the danger posed by Mr. Hands. Jim's ability to stay alert and think on his feet is a crucial survival skill he employs throughout the story as he navigates treacherous situations on Treasure Island.</p>
        <p>3. The ship's sudden impact with the sand and its subsequent canting over to the port side dramatically alters the course of the confrontation between Jim and Israel Hands. Initially, Jim and Hands were engaged in a tense standoff, with Hands approaching Jim with a drawn dirk. However, the ship's violent movement, caused by running aground, throws both Jim and Hands off balance. They are both capsized, and Jim is able to regain his footing more quickly. He manages to climb up the mizzen shrouds, a type of rigging on the mast, while Hands struggles to follow.</p>
        <p>This unexpected turn of events creates a significant advantage for Jim. He is positioned above Hands and has the opportunity to reload his pistol. Hands, on the other hand, is at a disadvantage, still trying to make his way up the rigging with a wounded leg. Jim's newfound vantage point allows him to threaten Hands with his pistol, and he effectively gains the upper hand in their confrontation. The ship's grounding ultimately saves Jim from potential harm and shifts the power dynamics in his favor.</p>

<br>
OWING to the cant of the vessel, the masts hung far out over the water,<br>
and from my perch on the <span class=GramE>cross-trees</span> I had nothing
below me but the<br>
surface of the bay. Hands, who was not so far up, was in consequence<br>
nearer to the ship and fell between me and the bulwarks. He rose once to<br>
the surface in a lather of foam and blood and then sank again for good.<br>
As the water settled, I could see him lying huddled together on the<br>
clean, bright sand in the shadow of the vessel's sides. A fish or two<br>
whipped past his body. Sometimes, by the quivering of the water, he<br>
appeared to move a little, as if he were trying to rise. But he was dead<br>
enough, for all that, being both shot and drowned, and was food for fish<br>
in the very place where he had designed my slaughter.<br>
<br>
I was no sooner certain of this than I began to feel sick, faint, and<br>
terrified. The hot blood was running over my back and chest. The dirk,<br>
where it had pinned my shoulder to the mast, seemed to burn like a hot<br>
iron; yet it was not so much these real sufferings that distressed me,<br>
for these, it seemed to me, I could bear without a murmur; it was the<br>
horror I had upon my mind of falling from the cross-trees into that<br>
still green water, beside the body of the coxswain.<br>
<br>
I clung with both hands till my nails ached, and I shut my eyes as if to<br>
cover up the peril. Gradually my mind came back again, my pulses quieted<br>
down to a more natural time, and I was once more in possession of<br>
myself.<br>
<br>
It was my first thought to pluck forth the dirk, but either it stuck too<br>
hard or my nerve failed me, and I desisted with a violent shudder. Oddly<br>
enough, that very shudder did the business. The knife, in fact, had come<br>
the nearest in the world to missing me altogether; it held me by a mere<br>
pinch of skin, and this the shudder tore away. The blood ran down the<br>
faster, to be sure, but I was my own master again and only tacked to the<br>
mast by my coat and shirt.<br>
<br>
These last I broke through with a sudden jerk, and then regained the<br>
deck by the starboard shrouds. For nothing in the world would I have<br>
again ventured, shaken as I was, upon the overhanging port shrouds from<br>
which Israel had so lately fallen.<br>
<br>
I went below and did what I could for my wound; it pained me a good deal<br>
and still bled freely, but it was neither deep nor dangerous, nor did it<br>
greatly gall me when I used my arm. Then I looked around me, and as the<br>
ship was now, in a sense, my own, I began to think of clearing it from<br>
its last passenger--the dead man, O'Brien.<br>
<br>
He had pitched, as I have said, against the bulwarks, where he lay<br>
like some horrible, ungainly sort of puppet, life-size, indeed, but how<br>
different from life's colour or life's comeliness! In that position<br>
I could easily have my way with him, and as the habit of tragical<br>
adventures had worn off almost all my terror for the dead, I took him<br>
by the waist as if he had been a sack of bran and with one good heave,<br>
tumbled him overboard. He went in with a sounding plunge; the red cap<br>
came off and remained floating on the surface; and as soon as the splash<br>
subsided, I could see him and Israel lying side by side, both wavering<br>
with the tremulous movement of the water. O'Brien, though still quite a<br>
young man, was very bald. There he lay, with that bald head across the<br>
knees of the man who had killed him and the quick fishes steering to and<br>
<span class=SpellE>fro</span> over both.<br>
<br>
I was now alone upon the ship; the tide had just turned. The sun was<br>
within so few degrees of setting that already the shadow of the pines<br>
upon the western shore began to reach right across the anchorage and<br>
fall in patterns on the deck. The evening breeze had sprung up, and<br>
though it was well warded off by the hill with the two peaks upon the<br>
east, the cordage had begun to sing a little softly to itself and the<br>
idle sails to rattle to and <span class=SpellE>fro</span>.<br>
<br>
I began to see a danger to the ship. The jibs I speedily doused and<br>
brought tumbling to the deck, but the <span class=GramE>main-sail</span> was a
harder matter. Of<br>
course, when the schooner canted over, the boom had swung out-board, and<br>
the cap of it and a foot or two of sail hung even under water. I thought<br>
this made it still more dangerous; yet the strain was so heavy that I<br>
half feared to meddle. At <span class=GramE>last</span> I got my knife and cut
the halyards. The<br>
peak dropped instantly, a great belly of loose canvas floated broad upon<br>
the water, and since, pull as I liked, I could not budge the <span
class=SpellE>downhall</span>,<br>
that was the extent of what I could accomplish. For the rest, the<br>
HISPANIOLA must trust to luck, like <span class=GramE>myself</span>.<br>
<br>
By this time the whole anchorage had fallen into shadow--the last rays,<br>
I remember, falling through a glade of the wood and shining bright as<br>
jewels on the flowery mantle of the wreck. It began to be chill; the<br>
tide was rapidly fleeting seaward, the schooner settling more and more<br>
on her beam-ends.<br>
<br>
I scrambled forward and looked over. It seemed shallow enough, and<br>
holding the cut hawser in both hands for a last security, I let myself<br>
drop softly overboard. The water scarcely reached my waist; the sand was<br>
firm and covered with ripple marks, and I waded ashore in great spirits,<br>
leaving the HISPANIOLA on her side, with her <span class=GramE>main-sail</span>
trailing wide<br>
upon the surface of the bay. About the same time, the sun went fairly<br>
down and the breeze whistled low in the dusk among the tossing pines.<br>
<br>
At least, and at last, I was off the sea, nor had I returned thence<br>
empty-handed. There lay the schooner, clear at last from buccaneers<br>
and ready for our own men to board and get to <span class=SpellE>sea</span>
again. I had nothing<br>
nearer my fancy than to get home to the stockade and boast of my<br>
achievements. Possibly I might be blamed a bit for my truantry, but the<br>
recapture of the HISPANIOLA was a clenching answer, and I hoped that<br>
even Captain Smollett would confess I had not lost my time.<br>
<br>
So thinking, and in famous spirits, I began to set my face homeward for<br>
the block house and my companions. I remembered that the most easterly<br>
of the rivers which drain into Captain Kidd's anchorage ran from the<br>
two-peaked hill upon my left, and I bent my course in that direction<br>
that I might pass the stream while it was small. The wood was pretty<br>
open, and keeping along the lower spurs, I had soon turned the corner<br>
of that hill, and not long after waded to the mid-calf across the<br>
watercourse.<br>
<br>
This brought me near to where I had encountered Ben Gunn, the maroon;<br>
and I walked more circumspectly, keeping an eye on every side. The dusk<br>
had come nigh hand completely, and as I opened out the cleft between the<br>
two peaks, I became aware of a wavering glow against the sky, where, as<br>
I judged, the man of the island was cooking his supper before a roaring<br>
fire. And yet I wondered, in my heart, that he should show himself so<br>
careless. For if I could see this radiance, might it not reach the eyes<br>
of Silver himself where he camped upon the shore among the marshes?<br>
<br>
Gradually the night fell blacker; it was all I could do to guide myself<br>
even roughly towards my destination; the double hill behind me and the<br>
Spy-glass on my right hand loomed faint and fainter; the stars were few<br>
and pale; and in the low ground where I wandered I kept tripping among<br>
bushes and rolling into sandy pits.<br>
<br>
Suddenly a kind of brightness fell about me. I looked up; a pale glimmer<br>
of moonbeams had alighted on the summit of the Spy-glass, and soon after<br>
I saw something broad and silvery moving low down behind the trees, and<br>
knew the moon had risen.<br>
<br>
With this to help me, I passed rapidly over what remained to me of my<br>
journey, and sometimes walking, sometimes running, impatiently drew near<br>
to the stockade. Yet, as I began to thread the grove that lies before<br>
it, I was not so thoughtless but that I slacked my pace and went a<br>
trifle warily. It would have been a poor end of my adventures to get<br>
shot down by my own party in mistake.<br>
<br>
The moon was climbing higher and higher, its light began to fall here<br>
and there in masses through the more open districts of the wood, and<br>
right in front of me a glow of a different colour appeared among<br>
the trees. It was red and hot, and now and again it was a little<br>
darkened--as it were, the embers of a bonfire smouldering.<br>
<br>
For the life of me I could not think what it might be.<br>
<br>
At last I came right down upon the borders of the clearing. The western<br>
end was already steeped in moonshine; the rest, and the block house<br>
itself, still lay in a black shadow chequered with long silvery streaks<br>
of light. On the other side of the house an immense fire had burned<br>
itself into clear embers and shed a steady, red reverberation,<br>
contrasted strongly with the mellow paleness of the moon. There was not<br>
a soul stirring nor a sound beside the noises of the breeze.<br>
<br>
I stopped, with much wonder in my heart, and perhaps a little terror<br>
also. It had not been our way to build great fires; we were, indeed,<br>
by the captain's orders, somewhat niggardly of firewood, and I began to<br>
fear that something had gone wrong while I was absent.<br>
<br>
I stole round by the eastern end, keeping close in shadow, and at a<br>
convenient place, where the darkness was thickest, crossed the palisade.<br>
<br>
To make assurance surer, I got upon my hands and knees and crawled,<br>
without a sound, towards the corner of the house. As I drew nearer, my<br>
heart was suddenly and greatly lightened. It is not a pleasant noise in<br>
itself, and I have often complained of it at other times, but just<br>
then it was like music to hear my friends snoring together so loud and<br>
peaceful in their sleep. The sea-cry of the watch, that beautiful &quot;All's<br>
well,&quot; never fell more reassuringly on my ear.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, there was no doubt of one thing; they kept an infamous<br>
bad watch. If it had been Silver and his lads that were now creeping<br>
in on them, not a soul would have seen daybreak. That was what it<br>
was, thought I, to have the captain wounded; and <span class=GramE>again</span>
I blamed myself<br>
sharply for leaving them in that danger with so few to mount guard.<br>
<br>
By this time I had got to the door and stood up. All was dark within,<br>
so that I could distinguish nothing by the eye. As for sounds, there<br>
was the steady drone of the snorers and a small occasional noise, a<br>
flickering or pecking that I could in no way account for.<br>
<br>
With my arms before me I walked steadily in. I should lie down in my own<br>
place (I thought with a silent chuckle) and enjoy their faces when they<br>
found me in the morning.<br>
<br>
My foot struck something yielding--it was a sleeper's leg; and he turned<br>
and groaned, but without awaking.<br>
<br>
And then, all of a sudden, a shrill voice broke forth out of the<br>
darkness:<br>
<br>
&quot;Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!<br>
Pieces of eight!&quot; and so forth, without pause or change, like the<br>
clacking of a tiny mill.<br>
<br>
Silver's green parrot, Captain Flint! It was she whom I had heard<br>
pecking at a piece of bark; it was she, keeping better watch than any<br>
human being, who thus announced my arrival with her wearisome refrain.<br>
<br>
I had no time left me to recover. At the sharp, clipping tone of the<br>
parrot, the sleepers awoke and sprang up; and with a mighty oath, the<br>
voice of Silver cried, &quot;Who goes?&quot;<br>
<br>
I turned to run, struck violently against one person, recoiled, and ran<br>
full into the arms of a second, who for his part closed upon and held me<br>
tight.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bring a torch, Dick,&quot; said Silver when my capture was thus assured.<br>
<br>
And one of the men left the log-house and presently returned with a<br>
lighted brand.<br>

        <p>1. The narrator got rid of the dead man, O'Brien, by taking him by the waist and tossing him overboard with one strong heave. O'Brien's body went into the water with a splash, and his red cap floated on the surface. After the splash subsided, the narrator could see O'Brien's lifeless body and Israel, who had also been killed, lying side by side in the water.</p>
        <p>2. The narrator secured the ship, HISPANIOLA, before leaving it by taking various actions. First, they doused and brought down the jibs to the deck. Then, they attempted to deal with the main-sail, which was submerged in the water due to the ship's canting. After struggling to pull the downhaul and fearing it was too dangerous to meddle with, they eventually cut the halyards, causing the main-sail to drop into the water. Despite these efforts, they had to leave the ship's fate to luck, as they waded ashore, leaving the ship on its side with the main-sail trailing wide on the bay's surface.</p>
        <p>3. When the narrator approached the stockade, they found a glowing, red-hot light among the trees, which appeared to be a bonfire smouldering. They had mixed emotions about the situation because they were uncertain about the source of the fire and feared that something might have gone wrong during their absence. They were relieved to hear their friends snoring peacefully inside the stockade, indicating that all was well for the moment, but they also realized that their companions were keeping a lax watch, which could have been dangerous if enemies like Silver and his crew had approached.</p>
