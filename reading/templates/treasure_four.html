    <p class="w3-large"><strong>16. Narrative Continued by the Doctor: How the Ship Was Abandoned</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
        <br>
IT was about half past one--three bells in the sea phrase--that the two<br>
boats went ashore from the HISPANIOLA. The captain, the squire, and I<br>
were talking matters over in the cabin. Had there been a breath of wind,<br>
we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with<br>
us, slipped our cable, and away to sea. But the wind was wanting; and<br>
to complete our helplessness, down came Hunter with the news that Jim<br>
Hawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest.<br>
<br>
It never occurred to us to doubt Jim Hawkins, but we were alarmed for<br>
his safety. With the men in the <span class=GramE>temper</span> they were in,
it seemed an even<br>
chance if we should see the lad again. We ran on deck. The pitch was<br>
bubbling in the seams; the nasty stench of the place turned me sick;<br>
if ever a man smelt fever and dysentery, it was in that abominable<br>
anchorage. The six scoundrels were sitting grumbling under a sail in the<br>
forecastle; ashore we could see the gigs made fast and a man sitting<br>
in each, hard by where the river runs in. One of them was whistling<br>
&quot;<span class=SpellE>Lillibullero</span>.&quot;<br>
<br>
Waiting was a strain, and it was decided that Hunter and I should go<br>
ashore with the <span class=GramE>jolly-boat</span> in quest of information.<br>
<br>
The gigs had <span class=SpellE>leaned</span> to their right, but Hunter and I
pulled straight in,<br>
in the direction of the stockade upon the chart. The two who were<br>
left guarding their boats seemed in a bustle at our appearance;<br>
&quot;<span class=SpellE>Lillibullero</span>&quot; stopped off, and I could see
the pair discussing what<br>
they ought to do. Had they gone and told Silver, all might have turned<br>
out differently; but they had their orders, I suppose, and decided to<br>
sit quietly where they were and hark back again to &quot;<span class=SpellE>Lillibullero</span>.&quot;<br>
<br>
There was a slight bend in the coast, and I steered so as to put it<br>
between us; even before we landed we had thus lost sight of the gigs.<br>
I jumped out and came as near running as I durst, with a big silk<br>
handkerchief under my hat for coolness' sake and a brace of pistols<br>
ready primed for safety.<br>
<br>
I had not gone a hundred yards when I reached the stockade.<br>
<br>
This was how it was: a spring of clear water rose almost at the top of a<br>
knoll. Well, on the knoll, and enclosing the spring, they had clapped a<br>
stout <span class=SpellE>loghouse</span> fit to hold two score of people on a
pinch and loopholed<br>
for musketry on either side. All round this they had cleared a wide<br>
space, and then the thing was completed by a paling six feet high,<br>
without door or opening, too strong to pull down without time and labour<br>
and too open to shelter the besiegers. The people in the log-house had<br>
them in every way; they stood quiet in shelter and shot the others like<br>
partridges. All they wanted was a good watch and food; for, short of a<br>
complete surprise, they might have held the place against a regiment.<br>
<br>
What particularly took my fancy was the spring. For though we had a good<br>
enough place of it in the cabin of the HISPANIOLA, with plenty of arms<br>
and ammunition, and things to eat, and excellent wines, there had been<br>
one thing overlooked--we had no water. I was thinking this over when<br>
there came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of<br>
death. I was not new to violent death--I have served his Royal Highness<br>
the Duke of <span class=GramE>Cumberland, and</span> got a wound myself at
Fontenoy--but I know<br>
my pulse went dot and carry one. &quot;Jim Hawkins is gone,&quot; was my first<br>
thought.<br>
<br>
It is something to have been an old soldier, but more still to have been<br>
a doctor. There is no time to dilly-dally in our work. And so now I made<br>
up my mind instantly, and with no time lost returned to the shore and<br>
jumped on board the <span class=GramE>jolly-boat</span>.<br>
<br>
By good fortune Hunter pulled a good oar. We made the water fly, and the<br>
boat was soon alongside and I aboard the schooner.<br>
<br>
I found them all shaken, as was natural. The squire was sitting down, as<br>
white as a sheet, thinking of the harm he had led us to, the good soul!<br>
And one of the six forecastle hands was little better.<br>
<br>
&quot;There's a man,&quot; says Captain Smollett, nodding towards him,
&quot;new to<br>
this work. He came nigh-hand fainting, doctor, when he heard the cry.<br>
Another touch of the rudder and that man would join us.&quot;<br>
<br>
I told my plan to the captain, and between us we settled on the details<br>
of its accomplishment.<br>
<br>
We put old Redruth in the gallery between the cabin and the forecastle,<br>
with three or four loaded muskets and a mattress for protection. Hunter<br>
brought the boat round under the stern-port, and Joyce and I set to work<br>
loading her with powder tins, muskets, bags of biscuits, kegs of pork, a<br>
cask of cognac, and my invaluable medicine chest.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, the squire and the captain stayed on deck, and the<br>
latter hailed the coxswain, who was the principal man aboard.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mr. Hands,&quot; he said, &quot;here are two of us with a brace of
pistols each.<br>
If any one of you six make a signal of any description, that man's<br>
dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
They were a good deal taken aback, and after a little consultation one<br>
and all tumbled down the fore companion, thinking no doubt to take us<br>
on the rear. But when they saw Redruth waiting for them in the sparred<br>
galley, they went about ship at once, and a head popped out again on<br>
deck.<br>
<br>
&quot;Down, dog!&quot; cries the captain.<br>
<br>
And the head popped back again; and we heard no more, for the time, of<br>
these six very faint-hearted seamen.<br>
<br>
By this time, tumbling things in as they came, we had the jolly-boat<br>
loaded as much as we dared. Joyce and I got out through the stern-port,<br>
and we made for shore again as fast as oars could take us.<br>
<br>
This second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore. &quot;<span
class=SpellE>Lillibullero</span>&quot;<br>
was dropped again; and just before we lost sight of them behind the<br>
little point, one of them whipped ashore and disappeared. I had half a<br>
mind to change my plan and destroy their boats, but I feared that Silver<br>
and the others might be close at hand, and all might very well be lost<br>
by trying for too much.<br>
<br>
We had soon touched land in the same place as before and set to<br>
provision the block house. All three made the first journey, heavily<br>
laden, and tossed our stores over the palisade. Then, leaving Joyce to<br>
guard them--one man, to be sure, but with half a dozen muskets--Hunter<br>
and I returned to the <span class=GramE>jolly-boat</span> and loaded ourselves
once more. So<br>
we proceeded without pausing to take breath, till the whole cargo was<br>
bestowed, when the two servants took up their position in the block<br>
house, and I, with all my power, sculled back to the HISPANIOLA.<br>
<br>
That we should have risked a second boat load seems more daring than it<br>
really was. They had the advantage of numbers, of course, but we had the<br>
advantage of arms. Not one of the men ashore had a musket, and before<br>
they could get within range for pistol shooting, we flattered ourselves<br>
we should be able to give a good account of a half-dozen at least.<br>
<br>
The squire was waiting for me at the stern window, all his faintness<br>
gone from him. He caught the painter and made it fast, and we fell to<br>
loading the boat for our very lives. Pork, powder, and biscuit was the<br>
cargo, with only a musket and a cutlass apiece for the squire and me<br>
and Redruth and the captain. The rest of the arms and powder we dropped<br>
overboard in two fathoms and a half of water, so that we could see<br>
the bright steel shining far below us in the sun, on the clean, sandy<br>
bottom.<br>
<br>
By this time the tide was beginning to ebb, and the ship was swinging<br>
round to her anchor. Voices were heard faintly halloaing in the<br>
direction of the two gigs; and though this reassured us for Joyce and<br>
Hunter, who were well to the eastward, it warned our party to be off.<br>
<br>
Redruth retreated from his place in the gallery and dropped into the<br>
boat, which we then brought round to the ship's counter, to be handier<br>
for Captain Smollett.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, men,&quot; said he, &quot;do you hear me?&quot;<br>
<br>
There was no answer from the forecastle.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's to you, Abraham Gray--it's to you I am speaking.&quot;<br>
<br>
Still no reply.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gray,&quot; resumed Mr. Smollett, a little louder, &quot;I am leaving
this ship,<br>
and I order you to follow your captain. I know you are a good man at<br>
bottom, and I dare say not one of the <span class=GramE>lot</span> of <span
class=SpellE>you's</span> as bad as he makes<br>
out. I have my watch here in my hand; I give you thirty seconds to join<br>
me in.&quot;<br>
<br>
There was a pause.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come, my fine fellow,&quot; continued the captain; &quot;don't hang so
long in<br>
stays. I'm risking my life and the lives of these good gentlemen every<br>
second.&quot;<br>
<br>
There was a sudden scuffle, a sound of blows, and <span class=SpellE>out burst</span>
Abraham<br>
Gray with a knife cut on the side of the cheek, and came running to the<br>
captain like a dog to the whistle.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm with you, sir,&quot; said he.<br>
<br>
And the next moment he and the captain had dropped aboard of us, and we<br>
had shoved off and given way.<br>
<br>
We were clear out of the ship, but not yet ashore in our stockade.<br>

        <p>1. The decision to send Hunter and the doctor ashore in the jolly-boat was prompted by the news that Jim Hawkins had gone ashore with the rest of the crew. The captain, the squire, and the doctor were concerned for Jim's safety, especially given the temper of the men left aboard the ship. Their mission was to go ashore and gather information about what was happening on the island.</p>
        <p>2. The stockade is located on a knoll near a spring of clear water. It is a stout loghouse that can hold up to two score people and is loopholed for musketry on both sides. The area around the stockade has been cleared to create a wide space. A six-foot-high palisade surrounds the stockade, with no door or opening, making it difficult to breach. The log-house occupants have the advantage of shelter and can shoot at attackers from inside. The stockade is strategically positioned to defend against any besiegers.</p>
        <p>3. The doctor and his companions quickly loaded supplies into the jolly-boat during their visit to the island. They loaded powder tins, muskets, bags of biscuits, kegs of pork, a cask of cognac, and the doctor's invaluable medicine chest. They also positioned old Redruth in the gallery between the cabin and the forecastle with muskets and a mattress for protection. Additionally, Hunter and Joyce loaded the jolly-boat with supplies, while the squire and the captain stayed on deck to deter any mutineers from taking action. The doctor and Hunter returned to the ship after each trip to the island, continuing to load supplies until the cargo was fully secured in the blockhouse.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>17. Narrative Continued by the Doctor: The Jolly-boat's Last Trip</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
        <br>
THIS fifth trip was quite different from any of the others. In the<br>
first place, the little gallipot of a boat that we were in was gravely<br>
overloaded. Five grown men, and three of them--Trelawney, Redruth, and<br>
the captain--over six feet high, was already more than she was meant<br>
to carry. Add to that the powder, pork, and bread-bags. The gunwale was<br>
lipping astern. Several times we shipped a little water, and my breeches<br>
and the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a<br>
hundred yards.<br>
<br>
The captain made us trim the boat, and we got her to lie a little more<br>
evenly. All the same, we were afraid to breathe.<br>
<br>
In the second place, the ebb was now making--a strong rippling current<br>
running westward through the basin, and then <span class=SpellE>south'ard</span>
and seaward down<br>
the straits by which we had entered in the morning. Even the ripples<br>
were a danger to our overloaded craft, but the worst of it was that we<br>
were swept out of our true course and away from our proper landing-place<br>
behind the point. If we let the current have its <span class=GramE>way</span>
we should come<br>
ashore beside the gigs, where the pirates might appear at any moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;I cannot keep her head for the stockade, sir,&quot; said I to the
captain.<br>
I was steering, while he and Redruth, two fresh men, were at the oars.<br>
&quot;The tide keeps washing her down. Could you pull a little stronger?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not without swamping the boat,&quot; said he. &quot;You must bear up,
sir, if you<br>
please--bear up until you see you're gaining.&quot;<br>
<br>
I tried and found by experiment that the tide kept sweeping us westward<br>
until I had laid her head due east, or just about right angles to the<br>
way we ought to go.<br>
<br>
&quot;We'll never get ashore at this rate,&quot; said I.<br>
<br>
&quot;If it's the only course that we can lie, sir, we must even lie it,&quot;<br>
returned the captain. &quot;We must keep upstream. You see, sir,&quot; he went
on,<br>
&quot;if once we dropped to leeward of the landing-place, it's hard to say<br>
where we should get ashore, besides the chance of being boarded by the<br>
gigs; whereas, the way we go the current must slacken, and then we can<br>
dodge back along the shore.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The current's less <span class=SpellE>a'ready</span>, sir,&quot; said the
man Gray, who was sitting in<br>
the fore-sheets; &quot;you can ease her off a bit.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you, my man,&quot; said I, quite as if nothing had happened, for we<br>
had all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the captain spoke up again, and I thought his voice was a<br>
little changed.<br>
<br>
&quot;The gun!&quot; said he.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have thought of that,&quot; said I, for I made sure he was thinking of
a<br>
bombardment of the fort. &quot;They could never get the gun ashore, and if<br>
they did, they could never haul it through the woods.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Look astern, doctor,&quot; replied the captain.<br>
<br>
We had entirely forgotten the long nine; and there, to our horror, were<br>
the five rogues busy about her, getting off her jacket, as they called<br>
the stout tarpaulin cover under which she sailed. Not only that, but<br>
it flashed into my mind at the same moment that the round-shot and the<br>
powder for the gun had been left behind, and a stroke with an axe would<br>
put it all into the possession of the evil ones abroad.<br>
<br>
&quot;Israel was Flint's gunner,&quot; said Gray hoarsely.<br>
<br>
At any risk, we put the boat's head direct for the landing-place. By<br>
this time we had got so far out of the run of the current that we kept<br>
steerage way even at our necessarily gentle rate of rowing, and I could<br>
keep her steady for the goal. But the worst of it was that with the<br>
course I now held we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the<br>
HISPANIOLA and offered a target like a barn door.<br>
<br>
I could hear as well as see that brandy-faced rascal Israel Hands<br>
plumping down a round-shot on the deck.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who's the best shot?&quot; asked the captain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mr. Trelawney, out and away,&quot; said I.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mr. Trelawney, will you please pick me off one of these men, sir?<br>
Hands, if possible,&quot; said the captain.<br>
<br>
Trelawney was as cool as steel. He looked to the priming of his gun.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now,&quot; cried the captain, &quot;easy with that gun, sir, or you'll
swamp the<br>
boat. All hands stand by to trim her when he aims.&quot;<br>
<br>
The squire raised his gun, the rowing ceased, and we leaned over to the<br>
other side to keep the balance, and all was so nicely contrived that we<br>
did not ship a drop.<br>
<br>
They had the gun, by this time, slewed round upon the swivel, and Hands,<br>
who was at the muzzle with the rammer, was in consequence the most<br>
exposed. However, we had no luck, for just as Trelawney fired, down he<br>
stooped, the ball whistled over him, and it was one of the other four<br>
who fell.<br>
<br>
The cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board but by a<br>
great number of voices from the shore, and looking in that direction<br>
I saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling<br>
into their places in the boats.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here come the gigs, sir,&quot; said I.<br>
<br>
&quot;Give way, then,&quot; cried the captain. &quot;We mustn't mind if we
swamp her<br>
now. If we can't get ashore, all's up.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Only one of the gigs is being manned, sir,&quot; I added; &quot;the crew
of the<br>
other most likely going round by shore to cut us off.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They'll have a hot run, sir,&quot; returned the captain. &quot;Jack
ashore, you<br>
know. It's not them I mind; it's the round-shot. Carpet bowls! My lady's<br>
maid couldn't miss. Tell us, squire, when you see the match, and we'll<br>
hold water.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the meanwhile we had been making headway at a good pace for a boat so<br>
overloaded, and we had shipped but little water in the process. We were<br>
now close in; thirty or forty strokes and we should beach her, for the<br>
ebb had already disclosed a narrow belt of sand below the clustering<br>
trees. The gig was no longer to be feared; the little point had already<br>
concealed it from our eyes. The <span class=GramE>ebb-tide</span>, which had so
cruelly delayed<br>
us, was now making reparation and delaying our assailants. The one<br>
source of danger was the gun.<br>
<br>
&quot;If I durst,&quot; said the captain, &quot;I'd stop and pick off another
man.&quot;<br>
<br>
But it was plain that they meant nothing should delay their shot. They<br>
had never so much as looked at their fallen comrade, though he was not<br>
dead, and I could see him trying to crawl away.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ready!&quot; cried the squire.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hold!&quot; cried the captain, quick as an echo.<br>
<br>
And he and Redruth backed with a great heave that sent her stern bodily<br>
under water. The report fell in at the same instant of time. This was<br>
the first that Jim heard, the sound of the squire's shot not having<br>
reached him. Where the ball passed, not one of us precisely knew, but I<br>
fancy it must have been over our heads and that the wind of it may have<br>
contributed to our disaster.<br>
<br>
At any rate, the boat sank by the stern, quite gently, in three feet of<br>
water, leaving the captain and myself, facing each other, on our feet.<br>
The other three took complete headers, and came up again drenched and<br>
bubbling.<br>
<br>
So far there was no great harm. No lives were lost, and we could wade<br>
ashore in safety. But there were all our stores at the bottom, and to<br>
make things worse, only two guns out of five remained in a state for<br>
service. Mine I had snatched from my knees and held over my head, by<br>
a sort of instinct. As for the captain, he had carried his over his<br>
shoulder by a bandoleer, and like a wise man, lock uppermost. The other<br>
three had gone down with the boat.<br>
<br>
To add to our concern, we heard voices already drawing near us in the<br>
woods along shore, and we had not only the danger of being cut off from<br>
the stockade in our half-crippled state but the fear before us whether,<br>
if Hunter and Joyce were attacked by half a dozen, they would have the<br>
sense and conduct to stand firm. Hunter was steady, that we knew; Joyce<br>
was a doubtful case--a pleasant, polite man for a valet and to brush<br>
one's clothes, but not entirely fitted for a man of war.<br>
<br>
With all this in our minds, we waded ashore as fast as we could, leaving<br>
behind us the poor jolly-boat and a good half of all our powder and<br>
provisions.<br>

        <p>1. During the jolly-boat's fifth trip ashore, it was gravely overloaded with five grown men, including Trelawney, Redruth, and the captain, who were all over six feet tall. In addition to the men, the boat carried powder, pork, and bread-bags. The boat's gunwale was lipping astern, and they had shipped water several times, causing the crew's clothes to become soaking wet. The situation was precarious due to the boat's heavy load and the danger of capsizing.</p>
        <p>2. As they attempted to navigate the boat ashore during the ebbing tide, several challenges emerged. First, the boat was being swept away from its proper landing place behind a point due to the strong rippling current running westward through the basin. Second, the boat's broadside was exposed to the HISPANIOLA, making it a vulnerable target. They were also being watched by pirates on shore, who were preparing to board their gig. Additionally, the boat had to be balanced carefully to avoid capsizing, which was made more difficult by the presence of the gun on board.</p>
        <p>3. When the crew realized that the pirates were attempting to take possession of the ship's gun, they decided to head directly for the landing place, even though it meant exposing their broadside to the HISPANIOLA and its crew. Trelawney, known as the best shot among them, was asked to pick off one of the pirates, specifically Israel Hands, who was handling the gun. Trelawney took aim, fired, and successfully shot one of the pirates. This led to a cry from the pirates on board and those on shore, but it also delayed the pirates' preparations. As a result, the gig manned by pirates was the only one approaching, and the crew of the jolly-boat was able to make it to shore, albeit with some challenges and the loss of their stores and some guns.</p>

    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
WE made our best speed across the strip of wood that now divided us from<br>
the stockade, and at every step we took the voices of the buccaneers<br>
rang nearer. Soon we could hear their footfalls as they ran and the<br>
cracking of the branches as they breasted across a bit of thicket.<br>
<br>
I began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest and looked to my<br>
priming.<br>
<br>
&quot;Captain,&quot; said I, &quot;Trelawney is the dead shot. Give him your
gun; his<br>
own is useless.&quot;<br>
<br>
They exchanged guns, and Trelawney, silent and cool as he had been since<br>
the beginning of the bustle, hung a moment on his heel to see that all<br>
was fit for service. At the same time, observing Gray to be unarmed, I<br>
handed him my cutlass. It did all our hearts good to see him spit in his<br>
hand, knit his brows, and make the blade sing through the air. It was<br>
plain from every line of his body that our new hand was worth his salt.<br>
<br>
Forty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood and saw the stockade<br>
in front of us. We struck the enclosure about the middle of the south<br>
side, and almost at the same time, seven mutineers--Job Anderson, the<br>
boatswain, at their head--appeared in full cry at the southwestern<br>
corner.<br>
<br>
They paused as if taken aback, and before they recovered, not only the<br>
squire and I, but Hunter and Joyce from the block house, had time to<br>
fire. The four shots came in rather a scattering volley, but they did<br>
the business: one of the <span class=GramE>enemy</span> actually fell, and the
rest, without<br>
hesitation, turned and plunged into the trees.<br>
<br>
After reloading, we walked down the outside of the palisade to see to<br>
the fallen enemy. He was stone dead--shot through the heart.<br>
<br>
We began to rejoice over our good success when just at that moment a<br>
pistol cracked in the bush, a ball whistled close past my ear, and poor<br>
Tom Redruth stumbled and fell his length on the ground. Both the squire<br>
and I returned the shot, but as we had nothing to aim at, it is probable<br>
we only wasted powder. Then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor<br>
Tom.<br>
<br>
The captain and Gray were already examining him, and I saw with half an<br>
eye that all was over.<br>
<br>
I believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers<br>
once more, for we were suffered without further molestation to get the<br>
poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried, groaning and<br>
bleeding, into the log-house.<br>
<br>
Poor old fellow, he had not uttered one word of surprise, complaint,<br>
fear, or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till<br>
now, when we had laid him down in the log-house to die. He had lain like<br>
a Trojan behind his mattress in the gallery; he had followed every order<br>
silently, doggedly, and well; he was the oldest of our party by a score<br>
of years; and now, sullen, old, serviceable servant, it was he that was<br>
to die.<br>
<br>
The squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand,<br>
crying like a child.<br>
<br>
&quot;Be I going, doctor?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tom, my man,&quot; said I, &quot;you're going home.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I wish I had had a lick at them with the gun first,&quot; he replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tom,&quot; said the squire, &quot;say you forgive me, won't you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Would that be respectful like, from me to you, squire?&quot; was the
answer.<br>
&quot;Howsoever, so be it, amen!&quot;<br>
<br>
After a little while of silence, he said he thought somebody might read<br>
a prayer. &quot;It's the custom, sir,&quot; he added apologetically. And not
long<br>
after, without another word, he passed away.<br>
<br>
In the meantime the captain, whom I had observed to be wonderfully<br>
swollen about the chest and pockets, had turned out a great many various<br>
stores--the British colours, a Bible, a coil of stoutish rope, pen, ink,<br>
the <span class=GramE>log-book</span>, and pounds of tobacco. He had found a
longish fir-tree<br>
lying felled and trimmed in the enclosure, and with the help of Hunter<br>
he had set it up at the corner of the log-house where the trunks crossed<br>
and made an angle. Then, climbing on the roof, he had with his own hand<br>
bent and run up the colours.<br>
<br>
This seemed mightily to relieve him. He re-entered the log-house and set<br>
about <span class=GramE>counting up</span> the stores as if nothing else
existed. But he had an<br>
eye on Tom's passage for all that, and as soon as all was over, came<br>
forward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't you take on, sir,&quot; he said, shaking the squire's hand.
&quot;All's<br>
well with him; no fear for a hand that's been shot down in his duty to<br>
captain and owner. It mayn't be good divinity, but it's a fact.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then he pulled me aside.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dr. Livesey,&quot; he said, &quot;in how many weeks do you and squire
expect the<br>
consort?&quot;<br>
<br>
I told him it was a question not of weeks but of months, that if we<br>
were not back by the end of August Blandly was to send to find us, but<br>
neither sooner nor later. &quot;You can calculate for yourself,&quot; I said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, yes,&quot; returned the captain, scratching his head; &quot;and
making a<br>
large allowance, sir, for all the gifts of Providence, I should say we<br>
were pretty close hauled.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How do you mean?&quot; I asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's a pity, sir, we lost that second load. That's what I mean,&quot;<br>
<span class=GramE>replied</span> the captain. &quot;As for powder and shot,
we'll do. But the rations<br>
are short, very short--so short, Dr. Livesey, that we're perhaps as well<br>
without that extra mouth.&quot;<br>
<br>
And he pointed to the dead body under the flag.<br>
<br>
Just then, with a roar and a whistle, a round-shot passed high above the<br>
roof of the log-house and plumped far beyond us in the wood.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oho!&quot; said the captain. &quot;Blaze away! You've little enough
powder<br>
already, my lads.&quot;<br>
<br>
At the second trial, the aim was better, and the ball descended inside<br>
the stockade, scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage.<br>
<br>
&quot;Captain,&quot; said the squire, &quot;the house is quite invisible from
the ship.<br>
It must be the flag they are aiming at. Would it not be wiser to take it<br>
in?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Strike my colours!&quot; cried the captain. &quot;No, sir, not I&quot;;
and as soon<br>
as he had said the words, I think we all agreed with him. For it was<br>
not only a piece of stout, <span class=SpellE>seamanly</span>, good feeling; it
was good policy<br>
besides and showed our enemies that we despised their cannonade.<br>
<br>
All through the evening they kept thundering away. Ball after ball flew<br>
over or fell short or kicked up the sand in the enclosure, but they had<br>
to fire so high that the shot fell dead and buried itself in the soft<br>
sand. We had no ricochet to fear, and though one popped in through the<br>
roof of the log-house and out again through the floor, we soon got used<br>
to that sort of <span class=GramE>horse-play</span> and minded it no more than
cricket.<br>
<br>
&quot;There is one good thing about all this,&quot; observed the captain;
&quot;the<br>
wood in front of us is likely clear. The ebb has made a good while; our<br>
stores should be uncovered. Volunteers to go and bring in pork.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gray and Hunter were the first to come forward. <span class=SpellE>Well armed</span>,
they stole<br>
out of the stockade, but it proved a useless mission. The mutineers were<br>
bolder than we fancied or they put more trust in Israel's gunnery. For<br>
four or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out<br>
with them to one of the gigs that lay close by, pulling an oar or so to<br>
hold her steady against the current. Silver was in the stern-sheets in<br>
command; and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some<br>
secret magazine of their own.<br>
<br>
The captain sat down to his log, and here is the beginning of the entry:<br>
<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Alexander Smollett, master; David
Livesey, ship's<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>doctor; Abraham Gray, carpenter's
mate; John<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Trelawney, owner; John Hunter and
Richard Joyce,<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>owner's servants, landsmen--being
all that is left<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>faithful of the ship's company--with
stores for ten<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>days at short rations, came ashore
this day and flew<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>British colours on the log-house in
Treasure Island.<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Thomas Redruth, owner's servant,
landsman, shot by the<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>mutineers; James Hawkins,
cabin-boy--<br>
<br>
And at the same time, I was wondering over poor Jim Hawkins' fate.<br>
<br>
A hail on the land side.<br>
<br>
&quot;Somebody hailing us,&quot; said Hunter, who was on guard.<br>
<br>
&quot;Doctor! Squire! Captain! Hullo, Hunter, is that you?&quot; came the
cries.<br>
<br>
And I ran to the door in time to see Jim Hawkins, safe and sound, come<br>
climbing over the stockade.<br>

        <p>1. As the crew approached the stockade after crossing the strip of woods, they could hear the approaching buccaneers' voices, footfalls, and cracking of branches as they neared. This signaled that they were in danger and would likely have to engage in a fight soon.</p>
        <p>2. When the crew encountered seven mutineers at the southwestern corner of the stockade, they opened fire on them. The crew members, including the squire, the doctor, Hunter, and Joyce, fired their weapons, and one of the mutineers fell. The remaining mutineers turned and fled into the trees. After reloading, the crew checked on the fallen enemy, who was shot through the heart, and confirmed that he was dead.</p>
        <p>3. Tom Redruth met his end when a pistol shot from the bush struck him, causing him to stumble and fall to the ground. Although the squire and the doctor returned fire, they had nothing to aim at, and their shots were likely wasted. Redruth was mortally wounded and eventually passed away. The crew reacted to his death with sorrow and respect, knowing that he had served faithfully and bravely throughout their journey. The squire knelt beside him, kissed his hand, and cried, while the crew members mourned the loss of their trusted companion.</p>

    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
AS soon as Ben Gunn saw the colours he came to a halt, stopped me by the<br>
arm, and sat down.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now,&quot; said he, &quot;there's your friends, sure enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Far more likely it's the mutineers,&quot; I answered.<br>
<br>
&quot;That!&quot; he cried. &quot;Why, in a place like this, where nobody puts
in but<br>
<span class=SpellE>gen'lemen</span> of fortune, Silver would fly the Jolly
Roger, you don't make<br>
no doubt of that. No, that's your friends. There's been blows too, and I<br>
reckon your friends has had the best of it; and here they are ashore in<br>
the old stockade, as was made years and years ago by Flint. Ah, he was<br>
the man to have a headpiece, was Flint! Barring rum, his match <span
class=GramE>were</span><br>
never seen. He <span class=GramE>were</span> afraid of none, not he; <span
class=SpellE>on'y</span> Silver--<span class=SpellE>Silver</span> was that<br>
genteel.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; said I, &quot;that may be so, and so be it; all the more
reason that<br>
I should hurry on and join my friends.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nay, mate,&quot; returned Ben, &quot;not you. You're a good boy, or I'm
mistook;<br>
but you're <span class=SpellE>on'y</span> a boy, all told. Now, Ben Gunn is
fly. Rum wouldn't<br>
bring me there, where you're going--not rum wouldn't, till I see your<br>
born <span class=SpellE>gen'leman</span> and gets it on his word of honour. And
you won't forget<br>
my words; 'A precious sight (that's what you'll say), a precious sight<br>
more confidence'--and then nips him.&quot;<br>
<br>
And he <span class=SpellE>pinched</span> me the third time with the same air of
cleverness.<br>
<br>
&quot;And when Ben Gunn is wanted, you know where to find him, Jim. Just<br>
<span class=SpellE>wheer</span> you found him today. And him that comes is to
have a white thing<br>
in his hand, and he's to come alone. Oh! And you'll say this: 'Ben<br>
Gunn,' says you, 'has reasons of his own.'&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; said I, &quot;I believe I understand. You have something to
propose,<br>
and you wish to see the squire or the doctor, and you're to be found<br>
where I found you. Is that all?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And when? says you,&quot; he added. &quot;Why, from about noon
observation to<br>
about six bells.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good,&quot; said I, &quot;and now may I go?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You won't forget?&quot; he inquired anxiously. &quot;Precious sight, and
reasons<br>
of his own, says you. Reasons of his own; that's the mainstay; as<br>
between man and man. Well, then&quot;--still holding me--&quot;I reckon you can<br>
go, Jim. And, Jim, if you <span class=GramE>was</span> to see Silver, you
wouldn't go for to sell<br>
Ben Gunn? Wild horses wouldn't draw it from you? No, says you. And if<br>
<span class=SpellE>them</span> pirates camp ashore, Jim, what would you say but
there'd be <span class=SpellE>widders</span><br>
in the morning?&quot;<br>
<br>
Here he was interrupted by a loud report, and a cannonball came tearing<br>
through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where<br>
we two were talking. The next moment each of us had taken to his heels<br>
in a different direction.<br>
<br>
For a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island, and<br>
balls kept crashing through the woods. I moved from hiding-place to<br>
hiding-place, always pursued, or so it seemed to me, by these terrifying<br>
missiles. But towards the end of the bombardment, though still I durst<br>
not venture in the direction of the stockade, where the balls fell<br>
oftenest, I had begun, in a manner, to pluck up my heart again, and<br>
after a long detour to the east, crept down among the shore-side trees.<br>
<br>
The sun had just set, the sea breeze was rustling and tumbling in the<br>
woods and ruffling the grey surface of the anchorage; the tide, too, was<br>
far out, and great tracts of sand lay uncovered; the air, after the heat<br>
of the day, chilled me through my jacket.<br>
<br>
The HISPANIOLA still lay where she had anchored; but, sure enough, there<br>
was the Jolly Roger--the black flag of piracy--flying from her peak.<br>
Even as I looked, there came another red flash and another report that<br>
sent the echoes clattering, and one more round-shot whistled through the<br>
air. It was the last of the cannonade.<br>
<br>
I lay for some time watching the bustle which succeeded the attack. Men<br>
were demolishing something with axes on the beach near the stockade--the<br>
poor <span class=GramE>jolly-boat</span>, I afterwards discovered. Away, near
the mouth of the<br>
river, a great fire was glowing among the trees, and between that point<br>
and the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going, the men, whom I<br>
had seen so gloomy, shouting at the oars like children. But there was a<br>
sound in their voices which suggested rum.<br>
<br>
At length I thought I might return towards the stockade. I was pretty<br>
far down on the low, sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east,<br>
and is joined at half-water to Skeleton Island; and now, as I rose to my<br>
feet, I saw, some distance further down the spit and rising from among<br>
low bushes, an isolated rock, <span class=GramE>pretty high</span>, and
peculiarly white in<br>
colour. It occurred to me that this might be the white rock of which Ben<br>
Gunn had spoken and that <span class=SpellE>some day</span> or other a boat
might be wanted and I<br>
should know where to look for one.<br>
<br>
Then I skirted among the woods until I had regained the rear, or<br>
shoreward side, of the stockade, and was soon warmly welcomed by the<br>
faithful party.<br>
<br>
I had soon told my story and began to look about me. The log-house was<br>
made of unsquared trunks of pine--roof, walls, and floor. The latter<br>
stood in several places as much as a foot or a foot and a half above the<br>
surface of the sand. There was a porch at the door, and under this porch<br>
the little spring welled up into an artificial basin of a rather odd<br>
kind--no other than a great ship's kettle of iron, with the bottom<br>
knocked out, and sunk &quot;to her bearings,&quot; as the captain said, among
the<br>
sand.<br>
<br>
Little had been left besides the framework of the house, but in one<br>
corner there was a stone slab laid down by way of hearth and an old<br>
rusty iron basket to contain the fire.<br>
<br>
The slopes of the knoll and all the inside of the stockade had been<br>
cleared of timber to build the house, and we could see by the stumps<br>
what a fine and lofty grove had been destroyed. Most of the soil had<br>
been washed away or buried in drift after the removal of the trees; only<br>
where the streamlet ran down from the kettle a thick bed of moss and<br>
some ferns and little creeping bushes were still green among the sand.<br>
Very close around the stockade--too close for defence, they said--the<br>
wood still flourished high and dense, all of fir on the land side, but<br>
towards the sea with a large admixture of live-oaks.<br>
<br>
The cold evening breeze, of which I have spoken, whistled through every<br>
chink of the rude building and sprinkled the floor with a continual rain<br>
of fine sand. There was sand in our eyes, sand in our teeth, sand in our<br>
suppers, sand dancing in the spring at the bottom of the kettle, for all<br>
the world like porridge beginning to boil. Our chimney was a square hole<br>
in the roof; it was but a little part of the smoke that found its way<br>
out, and the rest eddied about the house and kept us coughing and piping<br>
the eye.<br>
<br>
Add to this that Gray, the new man, had his face tied up in a bandage<br>
for a cut he had got in breaking away from the mutineers and that poor<br>
old Tom Redruth, still unburied, lay along the wall, stiff and stark,<br>
under the Union Jack.<br>
<br>
If we had been allowed to sit idle, we should all have fallen in the<br>
blues, but Captain Smollett was never the man for that. All hands were<br>
called up before him, and he divided us into watches. The doctor and<br>
Gray and I for one; the squire, Hunter, and Joyce upon the other. Tired<br>
though we all were, two were sent out for firewood; two more were set to<br>
dig a grave for Redruth; the doctor was named cook; I was put sentry at<br>
the door; and the captain himself went from one to another, keeping up<br>
our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted.<br>
<br>
From time to time the doctor came to the door for a little air and to<br>
rest his eyes, which were almost smoked out of his head, and whenever he<br>
did so, he had a word for me.<br>
<br>
&quot;That man Smollett,&quot; he said once, &quot;is a better man than I am.
And when<br>
I say that it means a deal, Jim.&quot;<br>
<br>
Another time he came and was silent for a while. Then he put his head on<br>
one <span class=GramE>side, and</span> looked at me.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is this Ben Gunn a man?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;I do not know, sir,&quot; said I. &quot;I am not very sure whether he's
sane.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If there's any doubt about the matter, he is,&quot; returned the doctor.
&quot;A<br>
man who has been three years biting his nails on a desert island, Jim,<br>
can't expect to appear as sane as you or me. It doesn't lie in human<br>
nature. Was it cheese you said he had a fancy for?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, sir, cheese,&quot; I answered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, Jim,&quot; says he, &quot;just see the good that comes of being
dainty in<br>
your food. You've seen my <span class=GramE>snuff-box</span>, haven't you? And
you never saw me<br>
take snuff, the reason being that in my <span class=GramE>snuff-box</span> I
carry a piece of<br>
Parmesan cheese--a cheese made in Italy, very nutritious. Well, that's<br>
for Ben Gunn!&quot;<br>
<br>
Before supper was <span class=GramE>eaten</span> we buried old Tom in the sand
and stood round<br>
him for a while bare-headed in the breeze. A good deal of firewood had<br>
been got in, but not enough for the captain's fancy, and he shook his<br>
head over it and told us we &quot;must get back to this tomorrow rather<br>
livelier.&quot; Then, when we had eaten our pork and each had a good stiff<br>
glass of brandy grog, the three chiefs got together in a corner to<br>
discuss our prospects.<br>
<br>
It appears they were at their wits' end what to do, the stores being so<br>
low that we must have been starved into surrender long before help came.<br>
But our best hope, it was decided, was to kill off the buccaneers until<br>
they either hauled down their flag or ran away with the HISPANIOLA. From<br>
nineteen they were already reduced to fifteen, two others were wounded,<br>
and one at least--the man shot beside the gun--severely wounded, if he<br>
were not dead. Every time we had a crack at them, we were to take it,<br>
saving our own lives, with the <span class=SpellE>extremest</span> care. And
besides that, we had<br>
two able allies--rum and the climate.<br>
<br>
As for the first, though we were about half a mile away, we could hear<br>
them roaring and singing late into the night; and as for the second,<br>
the doctor staked his wig that, camped where they were in the marsh<br>
and unprovided with remedies, the half of them would be on their backs<br>
before a week.<br>
<br>
&quot;So,&quot; he added, &quot;if we are not all shot down first they'll be
glad to<br>
be packing in the schooner. It's always a ship, and they can get to<br>
buccaneering again, I suppose.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;First ship that ever I lost,&quot; said Captain Smollett.<br>
<br>
I was dead tired, as you may fancy; and when I got to sleep, which was<br>
not till after a great deal of tossing, I slept like a log of wood.<br>
<br>
The rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the<br>
pile of firewood by about half as much again when I was wakened by a<br>
bustle and the sound of voices.<br>
<br>
&quot;Flag of truce!&quot; I heard someone <span class=GramE>say;</span> and
then, immediately after, with<br>
a cry of surprise, &quot;Silver himself!&quot;<br>
<br>
And at that, up I jumped, and rubbing my eyes, ran to a loophole in the<br>
wall.<br>

        <p>1. Ben Gunn is a character in the story who seems to have some important information or proposal for Jim Hawkins' friends. He wants to meet with them to discuss his information or proposal. He insists that Jim should inform his friends about the meeting and use the phrase "A precious sight, and reasons of his own" to identify him.</p>
        <p>2. The current situation on the island is tense and dangerous. Jim Hawkins and Ben Gunn are discussing the presence of a group of people, whom Jim initially thinks could be mutineers. Ben Gunn believes they are Jim's friends and mentions that there have been clashes between these people. The island is under bombardment from cannon fire, and a pirate ship, the Hispaniola, is anchored with the Jolly Roger (pirate flag) flying from its peak. There are signs of activity and drinking among the pirates on the island, and the stockade has been partially demolished.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>20. Silver's Embassy</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
SURE enough, there were two men just outside the stockade, one of them<br>
waving a white cloth, the other, no less a person than Silver himself,<br>
standing placidly by.<br>
<br>
It was still quite early, and the coldest morning that I think I ever<br>
was abroad in--a chill that pierced into the marrow. The sky was bright<br>
and cloudless overhead, and the tops of the trees shone rosily in<br>
the sun. But where Silver stood with his lieutenant, all was still in<br>
shadow, and they waded knee-deep in a low white vapour that had crawled<br>
during the night out of the morass. The chill and the vapour taken<br>
together told a poor tale of the island. It was plainly a damp,<br>
feverish, unhealthy spot.<br>
<br>
&quot;Keep indoors, men,&quot; said the captain. &quot;Ten to one this is a
trick.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then he hailed the buccaneer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who goes? Stand, or we fire.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Flag of truce,&quot; cried Silver.<br>
<br>
The captain was in the porch, keeping himself carefully out of the way<br>
of a treacherous shot, should any be intended. He turned and spoke to<br>
us, &quot;Doctor's watch on the lookout. Dr. Livesey take the north side,<br>
if you please; Jim, the east; Gray, west. The watch below, all hands to<br>
load muskets. Lively, men, and careful.&quot;<br>
<br>
And then he turned again to the mutineers.<br>
<br>
&quot;And what do you want with your flag of truce?&quot; he cried.<br>
<br>
This time it was the other man who replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;<span class=SpellE>Cap'n</span> Silver, sir, to come on board and make
terms,&quot; he shouted.<br>
<br>
&quot;<span class=SpellE>Cap'n</span> Silver! Don't know him. Who's he?&quot;
cried the captain. And we<br>
could hear him adding to himself, &quot;<span class=SpellE>Cap'n</span>, is it?
My heart, and here's<br>
promotion!&quot;<br>
<br>
Long John answered for himself. &quot;Me, sir. These poor lads have chosen me<br>
<span class=SpellE>cap'n</span>, after your desertion, sir&quot;--laying a
particular emphasis upon the<br>
word &quot;desertion.&quot; &quot;We're willing to submit, if we can come to
terms,<br>
and no bones about it. All I ask is your word, <span class=SpellE>Cap'n</span>
Smollett, to let me<br>
safe and sound out of this here stockade, and one minute to get out o'<br>
shot before a gun is fired.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My man,&quot; said Captain Smollett, &quot;I have not the slightest
desire to<br>
talk to you. If you wish to talk to me, you can come, that's all. If<br>
there's any treachery, it'll be on your side, and the Lord help you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's enough, <span class=SpellE>cap'n</span>,&quot; shouted Long John
cheerily. &quot;A word from <span class=SpellE>you's</span><br>
enough. I know a gentleman, and you may lay to that.&quot;<br>
<br>
We could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold<br>
Silver back. Nor was that wonderful, seeing how cavalier had been the<br>
captain's answer. But Silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the<br>
back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd. Then he advanced to the<br>
stockade, threw over his crutch, got a leg up, and with great vigour<br>
and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the<br>
other side.<br>
<br>
I will confess that I was far too much taken up with what was going on<br>
to be of the slightest use as sentry; indeed, I had already deserted<br>
my eastern loophole and crept up behind the captain, who had now seated<br>
himself on the threshold, with his elbows on his knees, his head in his<br>
hands, and his eyes fixed on the water as it bubbled out of the old iron<br>
kettle in the sand. He was whistling &quot;Come, Lasses and Lads.&quot;<br>
<br>
Silver had terrible hard work getting up the knoll. What with the<br>
steepness of the incline, the thick tree stumps, and the soft sand, he<br>
and his crutch were as helpless as a ship in stays. But he stuck to it<br>
like a man in silence, and at last arrived before the captain, whom<br>
he saluted in the handsomest style. He was tricked out in his best;<br>
an immense blue coat, thick with brass buttons, hung as low as to his<br>
knees, and a fine laced hat was set on the back of his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here you are, my man,&quot; said the captain, raising his head. &quot;You
had<br>
better sit down.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You <span class=SpellE>ain't</span> a-going to let me inside, <span
class=SpellE>cap'n</span>?&quot; complained Long John. &quot;It's<br>
a main cold morning, to be sure, sir, to sit outside upon the sand.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, Silver,&quot; said the captain, &quot;if you had pleased to be an
honest<br>
man, you might have been sitting in your galley. It's your own doing.<br>
You're either my ship's cook--and then you were treated handsome--or<br>
<span class=SpellE>Cap'n</span> Silver, a common mutineer and pirate, and then
you can go hang!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, well, <span class=SpellE>cap'n</span>,&quot; returned the sea-cook,
sitting down as he was<br>
bidden on the sand, &quot;you'll have to give me a hand up again, that's all.<br>
A sweet pretty place you have of it here. Ah, there's Jim! The top of<br>
the morning to you, Jim. Doctor, here's my service. Why, there you all<br>
are together like a happy family, in a manner of speaking.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If you have anything to say, my man, better say it,&quot; said the
captain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Right you were, <span class=SpellE>Cap'n</span> Smollett,&quot; replied
Silver. &quot;<span class=SpellE>Dooty</span> is <span class=SpellE>dooty</span>,
to be<br>
sure. Well now, you look here, that was a good lay of yours last<br>
night. I don't deny it was a good lay. Some of you <span class=GramE>pretty
handy</span> with a<br>
handspike-end. And I'll not deny neither but what some of my people was<br>
shook--maybe all was shook; maybe I was shook myself; maybe that's<br>
why I'm here for terms. But you mark me, <span class=SpellE>cap'n</span>, it
won't do twice, by<br>
thunder! We'll have to do sentry-go and ease off a point or so on the<br>
rum. Maybe you think we were all a sheet in the wind's eye. But I'll<br>
tell you I was sober; I was <span class=SpellE>on'y</span> dog tired; and if
I'd awoke a second<br>
sooner, I'd 'a caught you at the act, I would. He wasn't dead when I got<br>
round to him, not he.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well?&quot; says Captain Smollett as cool as can be.<br>
<br>
All that Silver said was a riddle to him, but you would never have<br>
guessed it from his tone. As for me, I began to have an inkling. Ben<br>
Gunn's last words came back to my mind. I began to suppose that he had<br>
paid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round<br>
their fire, and I reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen<br>
enemies to deal with.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, here it is,&quot; said Silver. &quot;We want that treasure, and
we'll have<br>
it--that's our point! You would just as soon save your lives, I reckon;<br>
and that's yours. You have a chart, haven't you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's as may be,&quot; replied the captain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, well, you have, I know <span class=GramE>that,</span>&quot; returned
Long John. &quot;You needn't be<br>
so husky with a man; there <span class=SpellE>ain't</span> a particle of
service in that, and you<br>
may lay to it. What I mean is, we want your chart. Now, I never meant<br>
you no harm, myself.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That won't do with me, my man,&quot; interrupted the captain. &quot;We
know<br>
exactly what you meant to do, and we don't care, for now, you see, you<br>
can't do it.&quot;<br>
<br>
And the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a pipe.<br>
<br>
&quot;If Abe Gray--&quot; Silver broke out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Avast there!&quot; cried Mr. Smollett. &quot;Gray told me nothing, and I
asked<br>
him nothing; and what's more, I would see you and him and this whole<br>
island blown clean out of the water into blazes first. <span class=GramE>So</span>
there's my<br>
mind for you, my man, on that.&quot;<br>
<br>
This little whiff of temper seemed to cool Silver down. He had been<br>
growing nettled before, but now he pulled himself together.<br>
<br>
&quot;Like enough,&quot; said he. &quot;I would set no limits to what gentlemen
might<br>
consider shipshape, or might not, as the case were. And <span class=SpellE>seein</span>'
as how<br>
you are about to take a pipe, <span class=SpellE>cap'n</span>, I'll make so
free as do likewise.&quot;<br>
<br>
And he filled a pipe and lighted it; and the two men sat silently<br>
smoking for quite a while, now looking each other in the face, now<br>
stopping their tobacco, now leaning forward to spit. It was as good as<br>
the play to see them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now,&quot; resumed Silver, &quot;here it is. You give us the chart to get
the<br>
treasure <span class=GramE>by, and</span> drop shooting poor seamen and stoving
of their heads in<br>
while asleep. You do that, and we'll offer you a choice. Either you come<br>
aboard along of us, once the treasure shipped, and then I'll give you my<br>
<span class=SpellE>affy-davy</span>, upon my word of honour, to clap you
somewhere safe ashore. Or<br>
if that <span class=SpellE>ain't</span> to your fancy, some of my hands being
rough and having<br>
old scores on account of hazing, then you can stay here, you can. We'll<br>
divide stores with you, man for man; and I'll give my <span class=SpellE>affy-davy</span>,
as<br>
before to speak the first ship I <span class=GramE>sight, and</span> send '<span
class=SpellE>em</span> here to pick you<br>
up. Now, you'll own that's talking. Handsomer you couldn't look to get,<br>
now you. And I hope&quot;--raising his voice--&quot;that all hands in this here<br>
block house will overhaul my words, for what is spoke to one is spoke to<br>
all.&quot;<br>
<br>
Captain Smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of his<br>
pipe in the palm of his left hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is that all?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Every last word, by thunder!&quot; answered John. &quot;Refuse that, and
you've<br>
seen the last of me but musket-balls.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Very good,&quot; said the captain. &quot;Now you'll hear me. If you'll
come up<br>
one by one, unarmed, I'll engage to clap you all in irons and take you<br>
home to a fair trial in England. If you won't, my name is Alexander<br>
Smollett, I've flown my sovereign's colours, and I'll see you all<br>
to Davy Jones. You can't find the treasure. You can't sail the<br>
ship--there's not a man among you fit to sail the ship. You can't fight<br>
us--Gray, there, got away from five of you. Your <span class=GramE>ship's</span>
in irons, Master<br>
Silver; you're on a lee shore, and so you'll find. I stand here and tell<br>
you so; and they're the last good words you'll get from me, for in the<br>
name of heaven, I'll put a bullet in your back when next I meet you.<br>
Tramp, my lad. Bundle out of this, please, hand over hand, and double<br>
quick.&quot;<br>
<br>
Silver's face was a picture; his eyes started in his head with wrath. He<br>
shook the fire out of his pipe.<br>
<br>
&quot;Give me a hand up!&quot; he cried.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not I,&quot; returned the captain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who'll give me a hand up?&quot; he roared.<br>
<br>
Not a man among us moved. Growling the foulest imprecations, he crawled<br>
along the sand till he got hold of the porch and could hoist himself<br>
again upon his crutch. Then he spat into the spring.<br>
<br>
&quot;There!&quot; he cried. &quot;That's what I think of ye. Before an hour's
out,<br>
I'll stove in your old block house like a rum puncheon. Laugh, by<br>
thunder, laugh! Before an hour's out, ye'll laugh upon the other side.<br>
Them that <span class=SpellE>die'll</span> be the lucky ones.&quot;<br>
<br>
And with a dreadful oath he stumbled off, ploughed down the sand, was<br>
helped across the stockade, after four or five failures, by the man with<br>
the flag of truce, and disappeared in an instant afterwards among the<br>
trees.<br>

        <p>1. Captain Smollett is highly skeptical of Long John Silver's request for a flag of truce. He believes it might be a trick and does not desire to engage in a conversation with Silver. He makes it clear that if Silver wishes to talk, he must come aboard the ship, and any treachery would be on Silver's side. Captain Smollett expresses his mistrust and reluctance to negotiate with Silver.</p>
        <p>2. Long John Silver proposes to Captain Smollett that if he provides them with the treasure map and refrains from harming the crew, they will spare their lives and even offer Captain Smollett a choice. The choices are either to join Silver's crew once the treasure is secured, with an assurance of safety ashore once it's done, or to stay on the island while Silver's crew divides supplies with them. Additionally, Silver promises to send help if they choose to stay, by signaling the first ship they see. This proposal is made in exchange for the treasure map.</p>
        <p>3. Captain Smollett responds to Long John Silver's ultimatum and threats with unwavering determination and a stern resolve. He offers the pirates a chance for a fair trial in England if they surrender one by one, unarmed. However, he also makes it clear that if they refuse to surrender, he will defend his position with force, even going so far as to threaten Silver personally. Captain Smollett dismisses Silver's threats and stands firm in his determination to protect his crew and the ship.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>21. The Attack</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
AS soon as Silver disappeared, the captain, who had been closely<br>
watching him, turned towards the interior of the <span class=GramE>house</span>
and found not a<br>
man of us at his post but Gray. It was the first time we had ever seen<br>
him angry.<br>
<br>
&quot;Quarters!&quot; he roared. And then, as we all slunk back to our places,<br>
&quot;Gray,&quot; he said, &quot;I'll put your name in the log; you've stood by
your<br>
duty like a seaman. Mr. Trelawney, I'm surprised at you, sir. Doctor,<br>
I thought you had worn the king's coat! If that was how you served at<br>
Fontenoy, sir, you'd have been better in your berth.&quot;<br>
<br>
The doctor's watch were all back at their loopholes, the rest were busy<br>
loading the spare muskets, and everyone with a red face, you may be<br>
certain, and a flea in his ear, as the saying is.<br>
<br>
The captain looked on for a while in silence. Then he spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;My lads,&quot; said he, &quot;I've given Silver a broadside. I pitched it
in<br>
red-hot on purpose; and before the hour's out, as he said, we shall be<br>
boarded. We're outnumbered, I needn't tell you that, but we fight in<br>
shelter; and a minute ago I should have said we fought with discipline.<br>
I've no manner of doubt that we can drub them, if you choose.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then he went the rounds and saw, as he said, that all was clear.<br>
<br>
On the two short sides of the house, east and west, there were only two<br>
loopholes; on the south side where the porch was, two again; and on the<br>
north side, five. There was a round score of muskets for the seven<br>
of us; the firewood had been built into four piles--tables, you might<br>
say--one about the middle of each side, and on each of these tables some<br>
ammunition and four loaded muskets were laid ready to the hand of the<br>
defenders. In the middle, the cutlasses lay ranged.<br>
<br>
&quot;Toss out the fire,&quot; said the captain; &quot;the chill is past, and we<br>
mustn't have smoke in our eyes.&quot;<br>
<br>
The iron fire-basket was carried bodily out by Mr. Trelawney, and the<br>
embers smothered among sand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hawkins hasn't had his breakfast. Hawkins, help yourself, and back to<br>
your post to eat it,&quot; continued Captain Smollett. &quot;Lively, now, my
lad;<br>
you'll want it before you've done. Hunter, serve out a round of brandy<br>
to all hands.&quot;<br>
<br>
And while this was going on, the captain completed, in his own mind, the<br>
plan of the defence.<br>
<br>
&quot;Doctor, you will take the door,&quot; he resumed. &quot;See, and don't
expose<br>
yourself; keep within, and fire through the porch. Hunter, take the east<br>
side, there. Joyce, you stand by the west, my man. Mr. Trelawney, you<br>
are the best shot--you and Gray will take this long north side, with the<br>
five loopholes; it's there the danger is. If they can get up to it and<br>
fire in upon us through our own ports, things would begin to look dirty.<br>
Hawkins, neither you nor I are much account at the shooting; we'll stand<br>
by to load and bear a hand.&quot;<br>
<br>
As the captain had said, the chill was past. As soon as the sun had<br>
climbed above our girdle of trees, it fell with all its force upon the<br>
clearing and drank up the vapours at a draught. Soon the sand was baking<br>
and the resin melting in the logs of the block house. Jackets and coats<br>
were flung aside, shirts thrown open at the neck and rolled up to the<br>
shoulders; and we stood there, each at his post, in a fever of heat and<br>
anxiety.<br>
<br>
An hour passed away.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hang them!&quot; said the captain. &quot;This is as dull as the doldrums.
Gray,<br>
whistle for a wind.&quot;<br>
<br>
And just at that moment came the first news of the attack.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you please, sir,&quot; said Joyce, &quot;if I see anyone, am I to
fire?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I told you so!&quot; cried the captain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; returned Joyce with the same quiet civility.<br>
<br>
Nothing followed for a time, but the remark had set us all on the alert,<br>
straining ears and eyes--the musketeers with their pieces balanced in<br>
their hands, the captain out in the middle of the block house with his<br>
mouth very tight and a frown on his face.<br>
<br>
So some seconds passed, till suddenly Joyce whipped up his musket<br>
and fired. The report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and<br>
repeated from without in a scattering volley, shot behind shot, like<br>
a string of geese, from every side of the enclosure. Several bullets<br>
struck the log-house, but not one entered; and as the smoke cleared away<br>
and vanished, the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and<br>
empty as before. Not a bough waved, not the gleam of a musket-barrel<br>
betrayed the presence of our foes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Did you hit your man?&quot; asked the captain.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, sir,&quot; replied Joyce. &quot;I believe not, sir.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Next best thing to tell the truth,<span class=GramE>&quot; muttered</span>
Captain Smollett. &quot;Load<br>
his gun, Hawkins. How many should say there were on your side, doctor?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know precisely,&quot; said Dr. Livesey. &quot;Three shots were fired on
this<br>
side. I saw the three flashes--two <span class=GramE>close</span> together--one
farther to the<br>
west.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Three!&quot; repeated the captain. &quot;And how many on yours, Mr.
Trelawney?&quot;<br>
<br>
But this was not so easily answered. There had come many from the<br>
north--seven by the squire's computation, eight or nine according to<br>
Gray. From the east and west only a single shot had been fired. It was<br>
plain, therefore, that the attack would be developed from the north and<br>
that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of<br>
hostilities. But Captain Smollett made no change in his arrangements. If<br>
the mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade, he argued, they would<br>
take possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats<br>
in our own stronghold.<br>
<br>
Nor had we much time left to us for thought. Suddenly, with a loud<br>
huzza, a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north side<br>
and ran straight on the stockade. At the same moment, the fire was once<br>
more opened from the woods, and a rifle ball sang through the doorway<br>
and knocked the doctor's musket into bits.<br>
<br>
The boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys. Squire and Gray fired<br>
again and yet again; three men fell, one forwards into the enclosure,<br>
two back on the outside. But of these, one was evidently more frightened<br>
than hurt, for he was on his feet again in a crack and instantly<br>
disappeared among the trees.<br>
<br>
Two had bit the dust, one had fled, four had made good their footing<br>
inside our defences, while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight<br>
men, each evidently supplied with several muskets, kept up a hot though<br>
useless fire on the log-house.<br>
<br>
The four who had boarded made straight before them for the building,<br>
shouting as they ran, and the men among the trees shouted back to<br>
encourage them. Several shots were fired, but such was the hurry of the<br>
marksmen that not one appears to have taken effect. In a moment, the<br>
four pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon us.<br>
<br>
The head of Job Anderson, the boatswain, appeared at the middle<br>
loophole.<br>
<br>
&quot;At '<span class=SpellE>em</span>, all hands--all hands!&quot; he roared
in a voice of thunder.<br>
<br>
At the same moment, another pirate grasped Hunter's musket by the<br>
muzzle, wrenched it from his hands, plucked it through the loophole,<br>
and with one stunning blow, laid the poor fellow senseless on the floor.<br>
Meanwhile a third, running unharmed all around the house, appeared<br>
suddenly in the doorway and fell with his cutlass on the doctor.<br>
<br>
Our position was utterly reversed. A moment since we were firing, under<br>
cover, at an exposed enemy; now it was we who lay uncovered and could<br>
not return a blow.<br>
<br>
The log-house was full of smoke, to which we owed our comparative<br>
safety. Cries and confusion, the <span class=GramE>flashes</span> and reports
of pistol-shots,<br>
and one loud groan rang in my ears.<br>
<br>
&quot;Out, lads, out, and fight '<span class=SpellE>em</span> in the open!
Cutlasses!&quot; cried the<br>
captain.<br>
<br>
I snatched a cutlass from the pile, and someone, at the same time<br>
snatching another, gave me a cut across the knuckles which I hardly<br>
felt. I dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight. Someone was<br>
close behind, I knew not whom. Right in front, the doctor was pursuing<br>
his assailant down the hill, and just as my eyes fell upon him, beat<br>
down his guard and sent him sprawling on his back with a great slash<br>
across the face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Round the house, lads! Round the house!&quot; cried the captain; and even
in<br>
the hurly-burly, I perceived a change in his voice.<br>
<br>
Mechanically, I obeyed, turned eastwards, and with my cutlass raised,<br>
ran round the corner of the house. Next moment I was face to face<br>
with Anderson. He roared aloud, and his hanger went up above his head,<br>
flashing in the sunlight. I had not time to be afraid, but as the blow<br>
still hung impending, leaped in a trice upon one side, and missing my<br>
foot in the soft sand, rolled headlong down the slope.<br>
<br>
When I had first sallied from the door, the other mutineers had been<br>
already swarming up the palisade to make an end of us. One man, in a red<br>
night-cap, with his cutlass in his mouth, had even got upon the top and<br>
thrown a leg across. Well, so short had been the interval that when I<br>
found my feet again all was in the same posture, the fellow with the red<br>
night-cap still half-way over, another still just showing his head above<br>
the top of the stockade. And yet, in this breath of time, the fight was<br>
over and the victory was ours.<br>
<br>
Gray, following close behind me, had cut down the big boatswain ere<br>
he had time to recover from his last blow. Another had been shot at a<br>
loophole in the very act of firing into the house and now lay in agony,<br>
the pistol still smoking in his hand. A third, as I had seen, the doctor<br>
had disposed of at a blow. Of the four who had scaled the palisade, one<br>
only remained unaccounted for, and he, having left his cutlass on the<br>
field, was now clambering out again with the fear of death upon him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fire--<span class=SpellE>fire</span> from the house!&quot; cried the
doctor. &quot;And you, lads, back into<br>
cover.&quot;<br>
<br>
But his words were unheeded, no shot was fired, and the last boarder<br>
made good his escape and disappeared with the rest into the wood. In<br>
three seconds nothing remained of the attacking party but the five who<br>
had fallen, four on the inside and one on the outside of the palisade.<br>
<br>
The doctor and Gray and I ran full speed for shelter. The survivors<br>
would soon be back where they had left their muskets, and at any moment<br>
the fire might recommence.<br>
<br>
The house was by this time somewhat cleared of smoke, and we saw at<br>
a glance the price we had paid for victory. Hunter lay beside his<br>
loophole, stunned; Joyce by his, shot through the head, never to move<br>
again; while right in the centre, the squire was supporting the captain,<br>
one as pale as the other.<br>
<br>
&quot;The captain's wounded,&quot; said Mr. Trelawney.<br>
<br>
&quot;Have they run?&quot; asked Mr. Smollett.<br>
<br>
&quot;All that could, you may be bound,&quot; returned the doctor; &quot;but
there's<br>
five of them will never run again.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Five!&quot; cried the captain. &quot;Come, that's better. Five against
three<br>
leaves us four to nine. That's better odds than we had at starting. We<br>
were seven to nineteen then, or thought we were, and that's as bad to<br>
bear.&quot;*<br>
<br>
*The mutineers were soon only eight in number, for the man shot by Mr.<br>
Trelawney on board the schooner died that same evening of his wound. But<br>
this was, of course, not known till after by the faithful party.<br>

        <p>1. Captain Smollett responds to the crew's lack of discipline and Long John Silver's ultimatum with a mix of anger and determination. He reprimands the crew members who abandoned their posts, praising only Gray for standing by his duty. Captain Smollett emphasizes the seriousness of the situation, acknowledging that they are outnumbered but suggesting that they have a chance to defend themselves effectively if they choose. He inspects the defense preparations and makes sure everything is in order, demonstrating his commitment to their survival. Captain Smollett's decisive leadership in this tense moment is evident as he takes control and prepares the crew for the impending attack.</p>
        <p>2. When the defenders, led by Captain Smollett, observed the approaching attack by the pirates, they were initially on high alert, with muskets in hand, and ready for action. They had been standing at their posts, anticipating an attack, and the sudden appearance of the pirates put them in a state of heightened anxiety. Captain Smollett had even earlier expressed his impatience at the lack of action, describing the situation as dull. As the pirates closed in, they fired their muskets in defense but did not manage to hit any of the attackers. The defenders were well-prepared and had their muskets ready, but the pirates managed to reach the stockade, and the battle intensified.</p>
        <p>3. The battle unfolded with Jim and others defending the house against attacking pirates. Jim evaded a strike from Anderson and fell down a slope. Meanwhile, the defenders managed to kill or incapacitate several attackers. In the end, the defenders repelled the attack, leaving five pirates dead and one fleeing. The defenders, including the wounded Captain Smollett, retreated to the house with casualties on their side but improved odds in the ongoing confrontation.</p>
