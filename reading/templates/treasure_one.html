    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
SQUIRE TRELAWNEY, Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having<br>
asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from<br>
the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the<br>
island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, I<br>
take up my pen in the year of grace 17__ and go back to the time when<br>
my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the<br>
sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof.<br>
<br>
I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the<br>
inn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow--a<br>
tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the<br>
shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with<br>
black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid<br>
white. I remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himself<br>
as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so<br>
often afterwards:<br>
<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>          </span>&quot;Fifteen men on the dead
man's chest--<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>             </span>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of
rum!&quot;<br>
<br>
in the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and<br>
broken at the capstan bars. Then he rapped on the door with a bit of<br>
stick like a handspike that he carried, and when my father appeared,<br>
called roughly for a glass of rum. This, when it was brought to him,<br>
he drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste and still<br>
looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is a handy cove,&quot; says he at length; &quot;and a pleasant <span
class=SpellE>sittyated</span><br>
<span class=GramE>grog-shop</span>. Much company, mate?&quot;<br>
<br>
My father told him no, very little company, the more was the pity.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, then,&quot; said he, &quot;this is the berth for me. Here you,
matey,&quot; he<br>
cried to the man who trundled the barrow; &quot;bring up alongside and help<br>
up my chest. I'll stay here a bit,&quot; he continued. &quot;I'm a plain man;
rum<br>
and bacon and eggs <span class=GramE>is</span> what I want, and that head up
there for to watch<br>
ships off. What you <span class=SpellE>mought</span> call me? You <span
class=SpellE>mought</span> call me captain. Oh, I<br>
see what you're at--<span class=SpellE>there</span>&quot;; and he threw down
three or four gold pieces<br>
on the threshold. &quot;You can tell me when I've worked through that,&quot;
says<br>
he, looking as fierce as a commander.<br>
<br>
And indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke, he had none<br>
of the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast, but seemed like<br>
a mate or skipper accustomed to <span class=GramE>be</span> obeyed or to
strike. The man who came<br>
with the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at<br>
the Royal George, that he had inquired what inns there were along the<br>
coast, and hearing ours <span class=SpellE>well spoken</span> of, I suppose,
and described as<br>
lonely, had chosen it from the others for his place of residence. And<br>
that was all we could learn of our guest.<br>
<br>
He was a very silent man by custom. All day he hung round the cove or<br>
upon the cliffs with a brass telescope; all evening he sat in a corner<br>
of the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water very strong. Mostly<br>
he would not speak when spoken to, only look up sudden and fierce and<br>
blow through his nose like a <span class=GramE>fog-horn</span>; and we and the
people who came<br>
about our house soon learned to let him be. Every day when he came back<br>
from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the<br>
road. At <span class=GramE>first</span> we thought it was the want of company
of his own kind<br>
that made him ask this question, but at last we began to see he was<br>
desirous to avoid them. When a seaman did put up at the Admiral Benbow<br>
(as now and then some did, making by the coast road for Bristol) he<br>
would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the<br>
parlour; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such<br>
was present. For me, at least, there was no secret about the matter, for<br>
I was, in a way, a sharer in his alarms. He had taken me aside one day<br>
and promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if I<br>
would only keep my &quot;weather-eye open for a seafaring man with one
leg&quot;<br>
and let him know the moment he appeared. Often enough when the first<br>
of the month came round and I applied to him for my wage, he would only<br>
blow through his nose at me and stare me down, but before the week was<br>
out he was sure to think better of it, bring me my four-penny piece, and<br>
repeat his orders to look out for &quot;the seafaring man with one leg.&quot;<br>
<br>
How that personage haunted my dreams, I need scarcely tell you. On<br>
stormy nights, when the wind shook the four corners of the house and<br>
the surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs, I would see him in a<br>
thousand forms, and with a thousand diabolical expressions. Now the leg<br>
would be cut off at the knee, now at the hip; now he was a monstrous<br>
kind of a creature who had never had but the one leg, and that in the<br>
middle of his body. To see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and<br>
ditch was the worst of nightmares. And altogether I paid <span class=GramE>pretty
dear</span> for<br>
my monthly fourpenny piece, in the shape of these abominable fancies.<br>
<br>
But though I was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one<br>
leg, I was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who<br>
knew him. There were nights when he took a deal more rum and water<br>
than his head would carry; and then he would sometimes sit and sing his<br>
wicked, old, wild sea-songs, minding nobody; but sometimes he would call<br>
for glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his<br>
stories or bear a chorus to his singing. <span class=GramE>Often</span> I have
heard the house<br>
shaking with &quot;Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum,&quot; all the neighbours
joining<br>
in for dear life, with the fear of death upon them, and each singing<br>
louder than the other to avoid remark. For in these <span class=GramE>fits</span>
he was the most<br>
overriding companion ever known; he would slap his hand on the table for<br>
silence all round; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question,<br>
or sometimes because none was put, and so he judged the company was not<br>
following his story. Nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he<br>
had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed.<br>
<br>
His stories were what frightened people worst of all. Dreadful stories<br>
they were--about hanging, and walking the plank, and storms at sea, and<br>
the Dry Tortugas, and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main. By his<br>
own account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men<br>
that God ever allowed upon the sea, and the language in which he told<br>
these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the<br>
crimes that he described. My father was always saying the inn would be<br>
ruined, for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over<br>
and put <span class=GramE>down, and</span> sent shivering to their beds; but I
really believe his<br>
presence did us good. People were frightened at the time, but on looking<br>
back they rather liked it; it was a fine excitement in a quiet country<br>
life, and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to<br>
admire him, calling him a &quot;true sea-dog&quot; and a &quot;real old
salt&quot; and<br>
such like names, and saying there was the sort of man that made England<br>
terrible at sea.<br>
<br>
In one way, indeed, he bade fair to ruin us, for he kept on staying week<br>
after week, and at last month after month, so that all the money had<br>
been long exhausted, and still my father never plucked up the heart to<br>
insist on having more. If ever he mentioned it, the captain blew through<br>
his nose so loudly that you might say he <span class=GramE>roared, and</span>
stared my poor<br>
father out of the room. I have seen him wringing his hands after such a<br>
rebuff, and I am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have<br>
greatly hastened his early and unhappy death.<br>
<br>
All the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his<br>
dress but to buy some stockings from a hawker. One of the cocks of his<br>
hat having <span class=GramE>fallen down</span>, he let it hang from that day
forth, though it<br>
was a great annoyance when it blew. I remember the appearance of his<br>
coat, which he patched himself upstairs in his room, and which, before<br>
the end, was nothing but patches. He never wrote or received a letter,<br>
and he never spoke with any but the neighbours, and with these, for the<br>
most part, only when drunk on rum. The great sea-chest none of us had<br>
ever seen open.<br>
<br>
He was only once crossed, and that was towards the end, when my poor<br>
father was far gone in a decline that took him off. Dr. Livesey came<br>
late one afternoon to see the patient, took a bit of dinner from my<br>
mother, and went into the parlour to smoke a pipe until his horse should<br>
come down from the hamlet, for we had no stabling at the old Benbow. I<br>
followed him in, and I remember observing the contrast the neat, bright<br>
doctor, with his powder as white as snow and his bright, black eyes and<br>
pleasant manners, made with the coltish country folk, and above all,<br>
with that filthy, heavy, bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours, sitting,<br>
far gone in rum, with his arms on the table. Suddenly he--the captain,<br>
that is--began to pipe up his eternal song:<br>
<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>          </span>&quot;Fifteen men on the dead
man's chest--<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>             </span>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of
rum!<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>           </span>Drink and the devil had done
for the rest--<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>             </span>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of
rum!&quot;<br>
<br>
At first I had supposed &quot;the dead man's chest&quot; to be that identical
big<br>
box of his upstairs in the front room, and the thought had been mingled<br>
in my nightmares with that of the one-legged seafaring man. But by this<br>
time we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song; it<br>
was new, that night, to nobody but Dr. Livesey, and on him I observed it<br>
did not produce an agreeable effect, for he looked up for a moment quite<br>
angrily before he went on with his talk to old Taylor, the gardener, on<br>
a new cure for the rheumatics. In the meantime, the captain gradually<br>
brightened up at his own music, and at last flapped his hand upon<br>
the table before him in a way we all knew to mean silence. The voices<br>
stopped at once, all but Dr. Livesey's; he went on as before speaking<br>
clear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word or<br>
two. The captain glared at him for a while, flapped his hand again,<br>
glared still harder, and at last broke out with a villainous, low oath,<br>
&quot;Silence, there, between decks!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Were you addressing me, sir?&quot; says the doctor; and when the ruffian
had<br>
told him, with another oath, that this was so, &quot;I have only one thing to<br>
say to you, sir,&quot; replies the doctor, &quot;that if you keep on drinking
rum,<br>
the world will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel!&quot;<br>
<br>
The old fellow's fury was awful. He sprang to his feet, <span class=GramE>drew</span>
and opened<br>
a sailor's clasp-knife, and balancing it open on the palm of his hand,<br>
threatened to pin the doctor to the wall.<br>
<br>
The doctor never so much as moved. He spoke to him as before, over his<br>
shoulder and in the same tone of voice, rather high, so that all the<br>
room might hear, but perfectly calm and steady: &quot;If you do not put that<br>
knife this instant in your pocket, I promise, upon my honour, you shall<br>
hang at the next assizes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then followed a battle of looks between them, but the captain soon<br>
knuckled under, put up his weapon, and resumed his seat, grumbling like<br>
a beaten dog.<br>
<br>
&quot;And now, sir,&quot; continued the doctor, &quot;since I now know there's
such a<br>
fellow in my district, you may count I'll have an eye upon you day and<br>
night. I'm not a doctor only; I'm a magistrate; and if I catch a breath<br>
of complaint against you, if it's only for a piece of incivility like<br>
tonight's, I'll take effectual means to have you hunted down and routed<br>
out of this. Let that suffice.&quot;<br>
<br>
Soon after, Dr. Livesey's horse came to the door and he rode away, but<br>
the captain held his peace that evening, and for many evenings to come.<br>
<br>

        <p>1. The captain was a brown, old seaman with a sabre cut on his cheek. He arrived at the Admiral Benbow inn carrying his sea-chest in a hand-barrow. He had a rugged appearance with a tarry pigtail, ragged hands, and a fierce demeanor</p>
        <p>2. The captain chose to stay at the Admiral Benbow inn because it was a quiet and lonely place. He was looking for a place to reside and enjoy rum, bacon, and eggs. He spent his time watching ships, drinking rum and water, and occasionally singing sea-songs. He was a very silent man, and he had a habit of avoiding other seafaring men who passed by the inn.</p>
        <p>3. The captain's presence both frightened and intrigued the people at the inn. Some admired him as a "true sea-dog," while others were terrified by his stories and behavior. His drinking and storytelling sometimes disrupted the inn's peaceful atmosphere. The one time he was confronted was when Dr. Livesey, a magistrate, warned him about his unruly behavior and threatened to have him hunted down if he caused trouble. This confrontation led to a tense moment but ultimately resulted in the captain calming down for a while.</p>

        <br>
IT was not very long after this that there occurred the first of the<br>
mysterious events that rid us at last of the captain, though not, as you<br>
will see, of his affairs. It was a bitter cold winter, with long, hard<br>
frosts and heavy gales; and it was plain from the first that my poor<br>
father was little likely to see the spring. He sank daily, and my mother<br>
and I had all the inn upon our hands, and were kept busy enough without<br>
paying much regard to our unpleasant guest.<br>
<br>
It was one January morning, very early--a pinching, frosty morning--the<br>
cove all grey with hoar-frost, the ripple lapping softly on the stones,<br>
the sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to<br>
seaward. The captain had risen earlier than usual and set out down the<br>
beach, his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat,<br>
his brass telescope under his arm, his hat tilted back upon his head. I<br>
remember his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off, and<br>
the last sound I heard of him as he turned the big rock was a loud snort<br>
of indignation, as though his mind was still running upon Dr. Livesey.<br>
<br>
Well, mother was upstairs with father and I was laying the<br>
breakfast-table against the captain's return when the parlour door<br>
opened and a man stepped in on whom I had never set my eyes before. He<br>
was a pale, tallowy creature, wanting two fingers of the left hand, and<br>
though he wore a cutlass, he did not look much like a fighter. I<br>
had always my eye open for seafaring men, with one leg or two, and I<br>
remember this one puzzled me. He was not sailorly, and yet he had a<br>
smack of the sea about him too.<br>
<br>
I asked him what was for his service, and he said he would take rum; but<br>
as I was going out of the room to fetch it, he sat down upon a table<br>
and motioned me to draw near. I paused where I was, with my napkin in my<br>
hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come here, sonny,&quot; says he. &quot;Come nearer here.&quot;<br>
<br>
I took a step nearer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is this here table for my mate Bill?&quot; he asked with a kind of leer.<br>
<br>
I told him I did not know his mate Bill, and this was for a person who<br>
stayed in our house whom we called the captain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; said he, &quot;my mate Bill would be called the captain, as
like<br>
as not. He has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him,<br>
particularly in drink, has my <span class=GramE>mate</span> Bill. We'll put it,
for argument<br>
like, that your captain has a cut on one cheek--and we'll put it, if you<br>
like, that that cheek's the right one. Ah, well! I told you. Now, is my<br>
mate Bill in this here house?&quot;<br>
<br>
I told him he was out walking.<br>
<br>
&quot;Which way, sonny? Which way is he gone?&quot;<br>
<br>
And when I had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain was<br>
likely to return, and how soon, and answered a few other questions,<br>
&quot;Ah,&quot; said he, &quot;this'll be as good as drink to my mate
Bill.&quot;<br>
<br>
The expression of his face as he said these words was not at all<br>
pleasant, and I had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was<br>
mistaken, even supposing he meant what he said. But it was no affair of<br>
mine, I thought; and besides, it was difficult to know what to do. The<br>
stranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door, peering round the<br>
corner like a cat waiting for a mouse. Once I stepped out myself into<br>
the road, but he immediately called me back, and as I did not obey quick<br>
enough for his fancy, a most horrible change came over his tallowy face,<br>
and he ordered me in with an oath that made me jump. As soon as I<br>
was back again he returned to his former manner, half fawning, half<br>
sneering, patted me on the shoulder, told me I was a good boy and he had<br>
taken quite a fancy to me. &quot;I have a son of my own,&quot; said he,
&quot;as like<br>
you as two blocks, and he's all the pride of my 'art. But the great<br>
thing for boys is discipline, sonny--discipline. Now, if you had sailed<br>
along of Bill, you wouldn't have stood there to be spoke <span class=GramE>to</span>
twice--not<br>
you. That was never Bill's way, nor the way of <span class=SpellE>sich</span>
as sailed with him.<br>
And here, sure enough, is my mate Bill, with a <span class=GramE>spy-glass</span>
under his arm,<br>
bless his old 'art, to be sure. You and <span class=SpellE>me'll</span> just go
back into the<br>
parlour, sonny, and get behind the door, and we'll give Bill a little<br>
surprise--bless his 'art, I say again.&quot;<br>
<br>
So saying, the stranger backed along with me into the parlour and put me<br>
behind him in the corner so that we were both hidden by the open door. I<br>
was very uneasy and alarmed, as you may fancy, and it rather added to my<br>
fears to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself. He<br>
cleared the hilt of his cutlass and loosened the blade in the sheath;<br>
and all the time we were waiting there he kept swallowing as if he felt<br>
what we used to call a lump in the throat.<br>
<br>
At last in strode the captain, slammed the door behind him, without<br>
looking to the right or left, and marched straight across the room to<br>
where his breakfast awaited him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bill,&quot; said the stranger in a voice that I thought he had tried to
make<br>
bold and big.<br>
<br>
The captain spun round on his heel and fronted us; all the brown had<br>
gone out of his face, and even his nose was blue; he had the look of a<br>
man who sees a ghost, or the evil one, or something worse, if anything<br>
can be; and upon my word, I felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn<br>
so old and sick.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come, Bill, you know me; you know an old shipmate, Bill, surely,&quot;
said<br>
the stranger.<br>
<br>
The captain made a sort of gasp.<br>
<br>
&quot;Black Dog!&quot; said he.<br>
<br>
&quot;And who else?&quot; returned the other, getting more at his ease.
&quot;Black<br>
Dog as ever was, come for to see his old shipmate Billy, at the Admiral<br>
Benbow inn. Ah, Bill, Bill, we have seen a sight of times, us two, since<br>
I lost them two talons,&quot; holding up his mutilated hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, look here,&quot; said the captain; &quot;you've run me down; here I
am;<br>
well, then, speak up; what is it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's you, Bill,&quot; returned Black Dog, &quot;you're in the right of
it,<br>
Billy. I'll have a glass of rum from this dear child here, as I've took<br>
such a liking to; and we'll sit down, if you please, and talk square,<br>
like old shipmates.&quot;<br>
<br>
When I returned with the rum, they were already seated on either side<br>
of the captain's breakfast-table--Black Dog next to the door and<br>
sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one, as I<br>
thought, on his retreat.<br>
<br>
He bade me go and leave the door wide open. &quot;None of your keyholes for<br>
me, sonny,&quot; he said; and I left them together and retired into the bar.<br>
<br>
For a long time, though I certainly did my best to listen, I could hear<br>
nothing but a low <span class=SpellE>gattling</span>; but at last the voices
began to grow higher,<br>
and I could pick up a word or two, mostly oaths, from the captain.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, no, no, no; and an end of it!&quot; he cried once. And again,
&quot;If it<br>
comes to swinging, swing all, say I.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then all of a sudden there was a tremendous explosion of oaths and<br>
other noises--the chair and table went over in a lump, a clash of steel<br>
followed, and then a cry of pain, and the next instant I saw Black<br>
Dog in full flight, and the captain hotly pursuing, both with drawn<br>
cutlasses, and the former streaming blood from the left shoulder. Just<br>
at the door the captain aimed at the fugitive one last tremendous<br>
cut, which would certainly have split him to the chine had it not been<br>
intercepted by our big signboard of Admiral Benbow. You may see the<br>
notch on the lower side of the frame to this day.<br>
<br>
That blow was the last of the battle. Once out upon the road, Black<br>
Dog, <span class=GramE>in spite of</span> his wound, showed a wonderful clean
pair of heels and<br>
disappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute. The captain, for<br>
his part, stood staring at the signboard like a bewildered man. Then he<br>
passed his hand over his eyes several times and at last turned back into<br>
the house.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jim,&quot; says he, &quot;rum&quot;; and as he spoke, he reeled a little,
and caught<br>
himself with one hand against the wall.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you hurt?&quot; cried I.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rum,&quot; he repeated. &quot;I must get away from here. Rum! Rum!&quot;<br>
<br>
I ran to fetch it, but I was quite unsteadied by all that had fallen<br>
out, and I broke one glass and fouled the tap, and while I was still<br>
getting in my own way, I heard a loud fall in the parlour, and running<br>
in, beheld the captain lying full length upon the floor. At the same<br>
instant my mother, alarmed by the cries and fighting, came running<br>
downstairs to help me. Between us we raised his head. He was breathing<br>
very loud and hard, but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible<br>
colour.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dear, deary me,&quot; cried my mother, &quot;what a disgrace upon the
house! And<br>
your poor father sick!&quot;<br>
<br>
In the meantime, we had no idea what to do to help the captain, nor any<br>
other thought but that he had got his death-hurt in the scuffle with<br>
the stranger. I got the rum, to be sure, and tried to put it down his<br>
throat, but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron.<br>
It was a happy relief for us when the door opened and Doctor Livesey<br>
came in, on his visit to my father.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, doctor,&quot; we cried, &quot;what shall we do? Where is he
wounded?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wounded? A fiddle-stick's end!&quot; said the doctor. &quot;No more
wounded than<br>
you or <span class=GramE>I.</span> The man has had a stroke, as I warned him.
Now, Mrs. Hawkins,<br>
just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him, if possible, nothing<br>
about it. For my part, I must do my best to save this fellow's trebly<br>
worthless life; Jim, you get me a basin.&quot;<br>
<br>
When I got back with the basin, the doctor had already ripped up the<br>
captain's sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm. It was tattooed<br>
in several places. &quot;Here's luck,&quot; &quot;A fair wind,&quot; and
&quot;Billy Bones his<br>
fancy,&quot; were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm; and up<br>
near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from<br>
it--done, as I thought, with great spirit.<br>
<br>
&quot;Prophetic,&quot; said the doctor, touching this picture with his finger.<br>
&quot;And now, Master Billy Bones, if that be your name, we'll have a look at<br>
the colour of your blood. Jim,&quot; he said, &quot;are you afraid of
blood?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, sir,&quot; said I.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, then,&quot; said he, &quot;you hold the basin&quot;; and with that
he took his<br>
lancet and opened a vein.<br>
<br>
A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes<br>
and looked mistily about him. <span class=GramE>First</span> he recognized the
doctor with<br>
an unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me, and he looked<br>
relieved. But suddenly his colour changed, and he tried to raise<br>
himself, crying, &quot;Where's Black Dog?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There is no Black Dog here,&quot; said the doctor, &quot;except what you
have<br>
on your own back. You have been drinking rum; you have had a stroke,<br>
precisely as I told you; and I have just, very much against my own will,<br>
dragged you headforemost out of the grave. Now, Mr. Bones--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's not my name,&quot; he interrupted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Much I care,&quot; returned the doctor. &quot;It's the name of a
buccaneer of my<br>
acquaintance; and I call you <span class=SpellE>by</span> it for the sake of
shortness, and what I<br>
have to say to you is this; one glass of rum won't kill you, but if<br>
you take one you'll take another and another, and I stake my wig if you<br>
don't break off short, you'll die--do you understand that?--die, and go<br>
to your own place, like the man in the Bible. Come, now, make an effort.<br>
I'll help you to your bed for once.&quot;<br>
<br>
Between us, with much trouble, we managed to hoist him upstairs, and<br>
laid him on his bed, where his head fell back on the pillow as if he<br>
were almost fainting.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, mind you,&quot; said the doctor, &quot;I clear my conscience--the
name of<br>
rum for you is death.&quot;<br>
<br>
And with that he went off to see my father, taking me with him by the<br>
arm.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is nothing,&quot; he said as soon as he had closed the door. &quot;I
have<br>
drawn blood enough to keep him <span class=SpellE>quiet</span> awhile; he
should lie for a week<br>
where he is--that is the best thing for him and you; but another stroke<br>
would settle him.&quot;<br>

        <p>1. The mysterious event involved the appearance of a stranger with missing fingers who entered the inn early in the morning. The stranger seemed to be looking for someone named Bill, whom he referred to as his mate. The captain of the inn, who was already inside, recognized the stranger as "Black Dog" and was involved in a confrontation with him.</p>
        <p>2. Black Dog" was described as a pale, tallowy man with missing fingers on his left hand. He wore a cutlass but did not appear to be a fighter. He entered the inn and asked for rum. He also asked about "mate Bill," who was actually the inn's captain. The captain returned to the inn, and a confrontation ensued between them. During the altercation, Black Dog was wounded and eventually fled from the inn.</p>
        <p>3. After the confrontation with "Black Dog," the captain collapsed and appeared to be in a life-threatening condition. He was pale, had difficulty breathing, and seemed to be having a stroke. Dr. Livesey arrived and quickly assessed that the captain had not been wounded but had suffered a stroke due to excessive rum consumption. Dr. Livesey treated the captain by opening a vein to relieve pressure, and the captain regained consciousness. Dr. Livesey warned the captain about the dangers of drinking rum and insisted that he must stop drinking, or he would die. The captain was then helped to his bed, where he needed to rest and avoid further alcohol consumption.</p>

        <br>
ABOUT noon I stopped at the captain's door with some cooling drinks<br>
and medicines. He was lying very much as we had left him, only a little<br>
higher, and he seemed both weak and excited.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jim,&quot; he said, &quot;you're the only one here that's worth anything,
and you<br>
know I've been always good to you. Never a month but I've given you a<br>
silver fourpenny for yourself. And now you see, mate, I'm pretty low,<br>
and deserted by all; and Jim, you'll bring me one noggin of rum, now,<br>
won't you, matey?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The doctor--&quot; I began.<br>
<br>
But he broke in cursing the doctor, in a feeble voice but heartily.<br>
&quot;Doctors is all swabs,&quot; he said; &quot;and that doctor there, why,
what do<br>
he know about seafaring men? I been in places hot as pitch, and mates<br>
dropping round with Yellow Jack, and the blessed land a-heaving like the<br>
sea with earthquakes--what to the doctor know of lands like <span class=GramE>that?--</span>and
I<br>
lived on rum, I tell you. It's been meat and drink, and man and wife,<br>
to me; and if I'm not to have my rum now I'm a poor old hulk on a lee<br>
shore, my <span class=SpellE>blood'll</span> be on you, Jim, and that doctor
swab&quot;; and he ran on<br>
again for a while with curses. &quot;Look, Jim, how my fingers <span
class=SpellE>fidges</span>,&quot;<br>
he continued in the pleading tone. &quot;I can't keep '<span class=SpellE>em</span>
still, not I. I<br>
haven't had a drop this blessed day. That doctor's a fool, I tell you.<br>
If I don't have a drain o' rum, Jim, I'll have the horrors; I seen some<br>
on '<span class=SpellE>em</span> already. I <span class=SpellE>seen</span> old
Flint in the corner there, behind you; as<br>
plain as print, I seen him; and if I get the horrors, I'm a man that<br>
has lived rough, and I'll raise Cain. Your doctor <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>hisself</span></span> said one glass<br>
wouldn't hurt me. I'll give you a golden guinea for a noggin, Jim.&quot;<br>
<br>
He was growing more and more excited, and this alarmed me for my father,<br>
who was very low that day and needed quiet; besides, I was reassured by<br>
the doctor's words, now quoted to me, and rather offended by the offer<br>
of a bribe.<br>
<br>
&quot;I want none of your money,&quot; said I, &quot;but what you owe my
father. I'll<br>
get you one glass, and no more.&quot;<br>
<br>
When I brought it to him, he seized it greedily and drank it out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, aye,&quot; said he, &quot;that's some better, sure enough. And now,
matey,<br>
did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A week at least,&quot; said I.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thunder!&quot; he cried. &quot;A week! I can't do that; they'd have the
black<br>
spot on me by then. The lubbers <span class=GramE>is</span> going about to get
the wind of me<br>
this blessed moment; lubbers as couldn't keep what they got, and want to<br>
nail what is another's. Is that <span class=SpellE>seamanly</span> behaviour,
now, I want to know?<br>
But I'm a saving soul. I never wasted good money of mine, nor lost it<br>
neither; and I'll trick '<span class=SpellE>em</span> again. I'm not afraid on
'<span class=SpellE>em</span>. I'll shake out<br>
another reef, matey, and <span class=SpellE>daddle</span> '<span class=SpellE>em</span>
again.&quot;<br>
<br>
As he was thus speaking, he had risen from bed with great difficulty,<br>
holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out, and<br>
moving his legs like so much dead weight. His words, spirited as they<br>
were in meaning, contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in<br>
which they were uttered. He paused when he had got into a sitting<br>
position on the edge.<br>
<br>
&quot;That doctor's done me,&quot; he murmured. &quot;My ears is singing. Lay
me back.&quot;<br>
<br>
Before I could do much to help <span class=GramE>him</span> he had fallen back
again to his<br>
former place, where he lay for a while silent.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jim,&quot; he said at length, &quot;you saw that seafaring man
today?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Black Dog?&quot; I asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah! Black Dog,&quot; says he. &quot;HE'S a bad un; but there's worse that
put him<br>
on. Now, if I can't get away <span class=SpellE>nohow</span>, and they tip me
the black spot, mind<br>
you, it's my old sea-chest they're after; you get on a horse--you can,<br>
can't you? Well, then, you get on a horse, and go to--well, yes,<br>
I <span class=GramE>will!--</span>to that eternal doctor swab, and tell him to
pipe all<br>
hands--magistrates and <span class=SpellE>sich</span>--and he'll lay '<span
class=SpellE>em</span> aboard at the Admiral<br>
Benbow--all old Flint's crew, man and boy, all on '<span class=SpellE>em</span>
that's left. I was<br>
first mate, I was, old Flint's first mate, and I'm the <span class=SpellE>on'y</span>
one as knows<br>
the place. He gave it me at Savannah, when he lay a-dying, like as if I<br>
was to now, you see. But you won't peach unless they get the black spot<br>
on me, or unless you see that Black Dog again or a seafaring man with<br>
one leg, Jim--him above all.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But what is the black spot, captain?&quot; I asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's a summons, mate. I'll tell you if they get that. But you keep<br>
your weather-eye open, Jim, and I'll share with you equals, upon my<br>
honour.&quot;<br>
<br>
He wandered a little longer, his voice growing weaker; but soon after I<br>
had given him his medicine, which he took like a child, with the remark,<br>
&quot;If ever a seaman wanted drugs, it's me,&quot; he fell at last into a
heavy,<br>
swoon-like sleep, in which I left him. What I should have done had all<br>
gone well I do not know. Probably I should have told the whole story to<br>
the doctor, for I was in mortal fear lest the captain should repent of<br>
his confessions and make an end of me. But as things fell out, my poor<br>
father died quite suddenly that evening, which put all other matters<br>
on one side. Our natural distress, the visits of the neighbours, the<br>
arranging of the funeral, and all the work of the inn to be carried on<br>
in the meanwhile kept me so busy that I had scarcely time to think of<br>
the captain, far less to be afraid of him.<br>
<br>
He got downstairs next morning, to be sure, and had his meals as usual,<br>
though he ate little and had more, I am afraid, than his usual supply of<br>
rum, for he helped himself out of the bar, scowling and blowing through<br>
his nose, and no one dared to cross him. On the night before the funeral<br>
he was as drunk as ever; and it was shocking, in that house of mourning,<br>
to hear him singing away at his ugly old sea-song; but weak as he was,<br>
we were all in the fear of death for him, and the doctor was suddenly<br>
taken up with a case many miles away and was never near the house after<br>
my father's death. I have said the captain was weak, and indeed he<br>
seemed rather to grow weaker than regain his strength. He clambered up<br>
and <span class=GramE>down stairs</span>, and went from the parlour to the bar
and back again,<br>
and sometimes put his nose out of doors to smell the sea, holding on to<br>
the walls as he went for support and breathing hard and fast like a man<br>
on a steep mountain. He never particularly addressed me, and it is my<br>
belief he had as good as forgotten his confidences; but his temper was<br>
<span class=GramE>more flighty</span>, and allowing for his bodily weakness,
more violent than<br>
ever. He had an alarming way now when he was drunk of drawing his<br>
cutlass and laying it bare before him on the table. But with all that,<br>
he minded people less and seemed shut up in his own thoughts and rather<br>
wandering. Once, for instance, to our extreme wonder, he piped up to a<br>
different air, a kind of country love-song that he must have learned in<br>
his youth before he had begun to follow the sea.<br>
<br>
So things passed until, the day after the funeral, and about three<br>
o'clock of a bitter, foggy, frosty afternoon, I was standing at the door<br>
for a moment, full of sad thoughts about my father, when I saw someone<br>
drawing slowly near along the road. He was plainly blind, for he tapped<br>
before him with a stick and wore a great green shade over his eyes and<br>
nose; and he was hunched, as if with age or weakness, and wore a huge<br>
<span class=GramE>old tattered</span> sea-cloak with a hood that made him
appear positively<br>
deformed. I never saw in my life a more dreadful-looking figure.<br>
He stopped a little from the inn, and raising his voice in an odd<br>
sing-song, addressed the air in front of him, &quot;Will any kind friend<br>
inform a poor blind man, who has lost the precious sight of his eyes in<br>
the gracious defence of his native country, England--and God bless King<br>
George!--where or in what part of this country he may now be?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You are at the Admiral Benbow, Black Hill Cove, my good man,&quot; said
I.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hear a voice,&quot; said he, &quot;a young voice. Will you give me your
hand,<br>
my kind young friend, and lead me in?&quot;<br>
<br>
I held out my hand, and the horrible, soft-spoken, eyeless creature<br>
gripped it in a moment like a <span class=SpellE>vise</span>. I was so much
startled that I<br>
struggled to withdraw, but the blind man pulled me close up to him with<br>
a single action of his arm.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, boy,&quot; he said, &quot;take me in to the captain.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir,&quot; said I, &quot;upon my word I dare not.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh,&quot; he sneered, &quot;that's it! Take me in straight or I'll break
your<br>
arm.&quot;<br>
<br>
And he gave it, as he spoke, a wrench that made me cry out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir,&quot; said I, &quot;it is for yourself I mean. The captain is not
what he<br>
used to be. He sits with a drawn cutlass. Another gentleman--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Come, now, march,&quot; interrupted he; and I never heard a voice so
cruel,<br>
and cold, and ugly as that blind <span class=GramE>man's</span>. It cowed me
more than the pain,<br>
and I began to obey him at once, walking straight in at the door and<br>
towards the parlour, where our sick old buccaneer was sitting, dazed<br>
with rum. The blind man clung close to me, holding me in one iron fist<br>
and leaning almost more of his weight on me than I could carry. &quot;Lead me<br>
straight up to him, and when I'm in view, cry out, 'Here's a friend<br>
for you, Bill.' If you don't, I'll do this,&quot; and with that he gave me a<br>
twitch that I thought would have made me faint. Between this and that, I<br>
was so utterly terrified of the blind beggar that I forgot my terror of<br>
the captain, and as I opened the parlour door, cried out the words he<br>
had ordered in a trembling voice.<br>
<br>
The poor captain raised his eyes, and at one look the rum went out of<br>
him and left him staring sober. The expression of his face was not so<br>
much of terror as of mortal sickness. He made a movement to rise, but I<br>
do not believe he had enough force left in his body.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, Bill, sit where you are,&quot; said the beggar. &quot;If I can't
see, I can<br>
hear a finger stirring. Business is business. Hold out your left hand.<br>
Boy, take his left hand by the wrist and bring it near to my right.&quot;<br>
<br>
We both obeyed him to the letter, and I saw him pass something from the<br>
hollow of the hand that held his stick into the palm of the captain's,<br>
which closed upon it instantly.<br>
<br>
&quot;And now that's done,&quot; said the blind man; and at the words he
suddenly<br>
left hold of me, and with incredible accuracy and nimbleness,<br>
skipped out of the parlour and into the road, where, as I still stood<br>
motionless, I could hear his stick go tap-tap-tapping into the distance.<br>
<br>
It was some time before either I or the captain seemed to gather our<br>
senses, but at length, and about at the same moment, I released his<br>
wrist, which I was still holding, and he drew in his hand and looked<br>
sharply into the palm.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ten o'clock!&quot; he cried. &quot;Six hours. We'll do them yet,&quot;
and he sprang<br>
to his feet.<br>
<br>
Even as he did so, he reeled, put his hand to his throat, stood swaying<br>
for a moment, and then, with a peculiar sound, fell from his whole<br>
height face foremost to the floor.<br>
<br>
I ran to him at once, calling to my mother. But haste was all in vain.<br>
The captain had been struck dead by thundering apoplexy. It is a curious<br>
thing to understand, for I had certainly never liked the man, though of<br>
late I had begun to pity him, but as soon as I saw that he was dead, I<br>
burst into a flood of tears. It was the second death I had known, and<br>
the sorrow of the first was still fresh in my heart.<br>

        <p>1. The blind beggar arrived at the inn and asked Jim to lead him to the captain. Jim was initially hesitant but was compelled to obey the beggar's orders as the beggar threatened him with physical harm. Jim reluctantly led the blind beggar to the captain, following the beggar's instructions to announce his presence. The captain was sitting in the parlour, and the blind beggar gave something to the captain while Jim held the captain's left hand. After this exchange, the blind beggar quickly left the parlour and the inn.</p>
        <p>2. During the interaction with the blind beggar, the captain appeared physically weak and unwell. He was described as dazed with rum and seemed to have lost his usual spirit. His face showed signs of sickness rather than terror, and he lacked the strength to rise from his chair without assistance. The captain's condition appeared to deteriorate rapidly in the presence of the blind beggar.</p>
        <p>3. After the blind beggar's visit, the captain's physical condition worsened. He attempted to rise but lacked the strength, and his face reflected extreme sickness. Suddenly, he reeled, clutched his throat, and fell face-first to the floor. The captain had a fatal stroke (apoplexy) and died. Jim was deeply affected by the captain's death and burst into tears. The captain's death was the second death Jim had experienced, and he was sorrowful, despite his earlier mixed feelings about the captain.</p>

I LOST no time, of course, in telling my mother all that I knew, and<br>
perhaps should have told her long before, and we saw ourselves at once<br>
in a difficult and dangerous position. Some of the man's money--if<br>
he had any--was certainly due to us, but it was not likely that our<br>
captain's shipmates, above all the two specimens seen by me, Black<br>
Dog and the blind beggar, would be inclined to give up their booty in<br>
payment of the dead man's debts. The captain's order to mount at<br>
once and ride for Doctor Livesey would have left my mother alone<br>
and unprotected, which was not to be thought of. Indeed, it seemed<br>
impossible for either of us to remain much longer in the house; the fall<br>
of coals in the kitchen grate, the very ticking of the clock, filled<br>
us with alarms. The neighbourhood, to our ears, seemed haunted by<br>
approaching footsteps; and what between the dead body of the captain<br>
on the parlour floor and the thought of that detestable blind beggar<br>
hovering near at hand and ready to return, there were moments when, as<br>
the saying goes, I jumped in my skin for terror. Something must speedily<br>
be resolved upon, and it occurred to us at last to go forth together<br>
and seek help in the neighbouring hamlet. No sooner said than done.<br>
Bare-headed as we were, we ran out at once in the gathering evening and<br>
the frosty fog.<br>
<br>
The hamlet lay not many hundred yards away, though out of view, on the<br>
other side of the next cove; and what greatly encouraged me, it was<br>
in an opposite direction from that whence the blind man had made his<br>
appearance and whither he had presumably returned. We were not many<br>
minutes on the road, though we sometimes stopped to lay hold of each<br>
other and hearken. But there was no unusual sound--nothing but the low<br>
wash of the ripple and the croaking of the inmates of the wood.<br>
<br>
It was already candle-light when we reached the hamlet, and I shall<br>
never forget how much I was cheered to see the yellow shine in doors and<br>
windows; but that, as it proved, was the best of the help we were likely<br>
to get in that quarter. For--you would have thought men would have been<br>
ashamed of themselves--no soul would consent to return with us to the<br>
Admiral Benbow. The more we told of our troubles, the more--man, woman,<br>
and child--they clung to the shelter of their houses. The name of<br>
Captain Flint, though it was strange to me, was well enough known to<br>
some there and carried a great weight of terror. Some of the men who<br>
had been to <span class=GramE>field-work</span> on the far side of the Admiral
Benbow remembered,<br>
besides, to have seen several strangers on the road, and taking them to<br>
be smugglers, to have bolted away; and one at least had seen a little<br>
lugger in what we called Kitt's Hole. For that matter, anyone who was a<br>
comrade of the captain's was enough to frighten them to death. And the<br>
short and the long of the matter was, that while we could get several<br>
who were willing enough to ride to Dr. Livesey's, which lay in another<br>
direction, not one would help us to defend the inn.<br>
<br>
They say cowardice is infectious; but then argument is, on the other<br>
hand, a great emboldener; and so when each had said his say, my mother<br>
made them a speech. She would not, she declared, lose money that<br>
belonged to her fatherless boy; &quot;If none of the rest of you dare,&quot;<br>
she said, &quot;Jim and I dare. Back we will go, the way we came, and small<br>
thanks to you big, hulking, chicken-hearted men. We'll have that chest<br>
<span class=GramE>open, if</span> we die for it. And I'll thank you for that
bag, Mrs. Crossley,<br>
to bring back our lawful money in.&quot;<br>
<br>
Of course I said I would go with my mother, and of course they all cried<br>
out at our foolhardiness, but even <span class=GramE>then</span> not a man
would go along with<br>
us. All they would do was to give me a loaded pistol lest we were<br>
attacked, and to promise to have horses ready saddled in case we were<br>
pursued on our return, while one lad was to ride forward to the doctor's<br>
in search of armed assistance.<br>
<br>
My heart was beating finely when we two set forth in the cold night upon<br>
this dangerous venture. A full moon was beginning to rise and peered<br>
redly through the upper edges of the fog, and this increased our haste,<br>
for it was plain, before we came forth again, that all would be as<br>
bright as day, and our departure exposed to the eyes of any watchers.<br>
We slipped along the hedges, noiseless and swift, nor did we see or hear<br>
anything to increase our terrors, till, to our relief, the door of the<br>
Admiral Benbow had closed behind us.<br>
<br>
I slipped the bolt at once, and we stood and panted for a moment in the<br>
dark, alone in the house with the dead captain's body. Then my mother<br>
got a candle in the bar, and holding each other's hands, we advanced<br>
into the parlour. He lay as we had left him, on his back, with his eyes<br>
open and one arm stretched out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Draw down the blind, Jim,&quot; whispered my mother; &quot;they might
come and<br>
watch outside. And now,&quot; said she when I had done so, &quot;we have to get<br>
the key off THAT; and who's to touch it, I should like to know!&quot; and she<br>
gave a kind of sob as she said the words.<br>
<br>
I went down on my knees at once. On the floor close to his hand there<br>
was a little round of paper, blackened on the one side. I could not<br>
doubt that this was the BLACK SPOT; and taking it up, I found written<br>
on the other side, in a very good, clear hand, this short message: &quot;You<br>
have till ten tonight.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He had till ten, Mother,&quot; said I; and just as I said it, our old
clock<br>
began striking. This sudden noise startled us shockingly; but the news<br>
was good, for it was only six.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, Jim,&quot; she said, &quot;that key.&quot;<br>
<br>
I felt in his pockets, one after another. A few small coins, a thimble,<br>
and some thread and big needles, a piece of pigtail tobacco bitten away<br>
at the end, his gully with the crooked handle, a pocket compass, and a<br>
tinder box were all that they contained, and I began to despair.<br>
<br>
&quot;Perhaps it's round his neck,&quot; suggested my mother.<br>
<br>
Overcoming a strong repugnance, I tore open his shirt at the neck, and<br>
there, sure enough, hanging to a bit of tarry string, which I cut with<br>
his own gully, we found the key. At this triumph we were filled with<br>
hope and hurried upstairs without delay to the little room where he had<br>
slept so long and where his box had stood since the day of his arrival.<br>
<br>
It was like any other seaman's chest on the outside, the initial &quot;B&quot;<br>
burned on the top of it with a hot iron, and the corners somewhat<br>
smashed and broken as by long, rough usage.<br>
<br>
&quot;Give me the key,&quot; said my mother; and though the lock was very
stiff,<br>
she had turned it and thrown back the lid in a twinkling.<br>
<br>
A strong smell of tobacco and tar rose from the interior, but nothing<br>
was to be seen on the top except a suit of very good clothes, carefully<br>
brushed and folded. They had never been worn, my mother said. Under<br>
that, the miscellany began--a quadrant, a tin <span class=SpellE>canikin</span>,
several sticks of<br>
tobacco, two brace of very handsome pistols, a piece of bar silver, an<br>
old Spanish watch and some other trinkets of little value and mostly of<br>
foreign make, a pair of compasses mounted with brass, and five or six<br>
curious West Indian shells. I have often wondered since why he should<br>
have carried about these shells with him in his wandering, guilty, and<br>
hunted life.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, we had found nothing of any value but the silver and<br>
the trinkets, and neither of these were in our way. Underneath there<br>
was an old boat-cloak, whitened with sea-salt on many a harbour-bar. My<br>
mother pulled it up with impatience, and there lay before us, the last<br>
things in the chest, a bundle tied up in oilcloth, and looking like<br>
papers, and a canvas bag that gave forth, at a touch, the jingle of<br>
gold.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll show these rogues that I'm an honest woman,&quot; said my mother.
&quot;I'll<br>
have my dues, and not a farthing over. Hold Mrs. Crossley's bag.&quot; And<br>
she began to count over the amount of the captain's score from the<br>
sailor's bag into the one that I was holding.<br>
<br>
It was a long, difficult business, for the coins were of all countries<br>
and sizes--doubloons, and louis <span class=SpellE>d'ors</span>, and guineas,
and pieces of eight,<br>
and I know not what besides, all shaken together at random. The guineas,<br>
too, were about the scarcest, and it was with these only that my mother<br>
knew how to make her count.<br>
<br>
When we were about half-way through, I suddenly put my hand upon her<br>
arm, for I had heard in the silent frosty air a sound that brought my<br>
heart into my mouth--the tap-tapping of the blind man's stick upon the<br>
frozen road. It drew nearer and nearer, while we sat holding our breath.<br>
Then it struck sharp on the inn door, and then we could hear the handle<br>
being turned and the bolt rattling as the wretched being tried to enter;<br>
and then there was a long time of silence both within and without.<br>
At last the tapping recommenced, and, to our indescribable joy and<br>
gratitude, died slowly away again until it ceased to be heard.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mother,&quot; said I, &quot;take the whole and let's be going,&quot; for
I was sure<br>
the bolted door must have seemed suspicious and would bring the whole<br>
hornet's nest about our ears, though how thankful I was that I had<br>
bolted it, none could tell who had never met that terrible blind man.<br>
<br>
But my mother, frightened as she was, would not consent to take a<br>
fraction more than was due to her and was obstinately unwilling to be<br>
content with less. It was not yet seven, she said, by a long way; she<br>
knew her rights and she would have them; and she was still arguing with<br>
me when a little low whistle sounded a good way off upon the hill. That<br>
was enough, and more than enough, for both of us.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll take what I have,&quot; she said, jumping to her feet.<br>
<br>
&quot;And I'll take this to square the count,&quot; said I, picking up the
oilskin<br>
packet.<br>
<br>
Next moment we were both groping downstairs, leaving the candle by<br>
the empty chest; and the next we had opened the door and were in full<br>
retreat. We had not started a moment too soon. The fog was rapidly<br>
dispersing; already the moon shone quite clear on the high ground on<br>
either side; and it was only in the exact bottom of the dell and round<br>
the tavern door that a thin veil still hung unbroken to conceal the<br>
first steps of our escape. Far less than half-way to the hamlet, very<br>
little beyond the bottom of the hill, we must come forth into the<br>
moonlight. Nor was this all, for the sound of several footsteps running<br>
came already to our ears, and as we looked back in their direction, a<br>
light tossing to and <span class=SpellE>fro</span> and still rapidly advancing
showed that one of<br>
the newcomers carried a lantern.<br>
<br>
&quot;My dear,&quot; said my mother suddenly, &quot;take the money and run on.
I am<br>
going to faint.&quot;<br>
<br>
This was certainly the end for both of us, I thought. How I cursed the<br>
cowardice of the neighbours; how I blamed my poor mother for her honesty<br>
and her greed, for her past foolhardiness and present weakness! We were<br>
just at the little bridge, by good fortune; and I helped her, tottering<br>
as she was, to the edge of the bank, where, sure enough, she gave a sigh<br>
and fell on my shoulder. I do not know how I found the strength to do it<br>
at all, and I am afraid it was roughly done, but I managed to drag her<br>
down the bank and a little way under the arch. Farther I could not move<br>
her, for the bridge was too low to let me do more than crawl below it.<br>
So there we had to stay--my mother almost entirely exposed and both of<br>
us within earshot of the inn.<br>

        <p>1. Jim and his mother decided to leave the inn and seek help in the neighbouring hamlet because they found themselves in a dangerous situation. They had just discovered a chest of valuables that belonged to the deceased captain, and they were aware that the captain's shipmates, particularly Black Dog and the blind beggar, might come looking for the chest. They also felt that the neighbourhood was filled with ominous sounds and approaching footsteps, which made them fearful. Additionally, they couldn't leave Jim's mother alone and unprotected in the inn.</p>
        <p>2. The people in the neighbouring hamlet were unwilling to help Jim and his mother defend the inn because they were afraid of Captain Flint, whose name carried a great weight of terror. Some of the men had seen strangers on the road, which they believed to be smugglers, and had fled in fear. Anyone associated with Captain Flint was enough to frighten them. Therefore, despite Jim and his mother's pleas for assistance, none of the villagers were willing to accompany them back to the Admiral Benbow inn.</p>
        <p>3. Inside the chest they discovered in the captain's room, Jim and his mother found various items. Initially, they found a suit of very good clothes, which appeared to have never been worn. Beneath the clothing, there were other items, including a quadrant, a tin canikin, several sticks of tobacco, two handsome pistols, a piece of bar silver, an old Spanish watch, and some trinkets of little value. They also found a pair of compasses mounted with brass and several West Indian shells. However, the most significant discovery was a bundle tied up in oilcloth, which appeared to be papers, and a canvas bag filled with the jingle of gold coins. Upon finding the gold coins, Jim's mother began counting the money, determined to take what was rightfully due to them. She refused to take a fraction more or less than what she believed belonged to her. Jim was initially worried about their safety, as the bolted door might seem suspicious, but he followed his mother's lead. They counted the money and prepared to leave, hoping to escape with their findings.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>5. The Last of the Blind Man</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
MY curiosity, in a sense, was stronger than my fear, for I could not<br>
remain where I was, but crept back to the bank again, whence, sheltering<br>
my head behind a bush of broom, I might command the road before our<br>
door. I was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive, seven<br>
or eight of them, running hard, their feet beating out of time along<br>
the road and the man with the lantern some paces in front. Three men ran<br>
together, hand in hand; and I made out, even <span class=SpellE>through</span>
the mist, that the<br>
<span class=GramE>middle man</span> of this trio was the blind beggar. The next
moment his voice<br>
showed me that I was right.<br>
<br>
&quot;Down with the door!&quot; he cried.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, aye, sir!&quot; answered two or three; and a rush was made upon the<br>
Admiral Benbow, the lantern-bearer following; and then I could see<br>
them pause, and hear speeches passed in a lower key, as if they were<br>
surprised to find the door open. But the pause was brief, for the blind<br>
man again issued his commands. His voice sounded louder and higher, as<br>
if he were afire with eagerness and rage.<br>
<br>
&quot;In, in, in!&quot; he shouted, and cursed them for their delay.<br>
<br>
Four or five of them obeyed at once, two remaining on the road with the<br>
formidable beggar. There was a pause, then a cry of surprise, and then a<br>
voice shouting from the house, &quot;Bill's dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
But the blind man swore at them again for their delay.<br>
<br>
&quot;Search him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest of you aloft and<br>
get the chest,&quot; he cried.<br>
<br>
I could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that the<br>
house must have shook with it. Promptly afterwards, fresh sounds of<br>
astonishment arose; the window of the captain's room was thrown open<br>
with a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out into the<br>
moonlight, <span class=GramE>head</span> and shoulders, and addressed the blind
beggar on the<br>
road below him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pew,&quot; he cried, &quot;they've been before us. Someone's turned the
chest out<br>
<span class=SpellE>alow</span> and aloft.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Is it there?&quot; roared Pew.<br>
<br>
&quot;The money's there.&quot;<br>
<br>
The blind man cursed the money.<br>
<br>
&quot;Flint's fist, I mean,&quot; he cried.<br>
<br>
&quot;We don't see it here <span class=SpellE>nohow</span>,&quot; returned the
man.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here, you below there, is it on Bill?&quot; cried the blind man again.<br>
<br>
At that another fellow, probably him who had remained below to search<br>
the captain's body, came to the door of the inn. &quot;Bill's been overhauled<br>
<span class=SpellE>a'ready</span>,&quot; said he; &quot;<span class=SpellE>nothin</span>'
left.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's these people of the inn--it's that boy. I wish I had put his eyes<br>
out!&quot; cried the blind man, Pew. &quot;There <span class=GramE>were</span>
no time ago--they had the<br>
door bolted when I tried it. Scatter, lads, and find '<span class=SpellE>em</span>.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure enough, they left their glim here,&quot; said the fellow from the<br>
window.<br>
<br>
&quot;Scatter and find '<span class=SpellE>em</span>! Rout the house out!&quot;
reiterated Pew, striking<br>
with his stick upon the road.<br>
<br>
Then there followed a great to-do through all our old inn, heavy feet<br>
pounding to and <span class=SpellE>fro</span>, furniture thrown over, doors
kicked in, until the<br>
very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one after another, on<br>
the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found. And just<br>
the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead<br>
captain's money was once more clearly audible through the night,<br>
but this time twice repeated. I had thought it to be the blind man's<br>
trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but I now found<br>
that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its<br>
effect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger.<br>
<br>
&quot;There's Dirk again,&quot; said one. &quot;Twice! We'll have to budge,
mates.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Budge, you skulk!&quot; cried Pew. &quot;Dirk was a fool and a coward
from the<br>
first--you wouldn't mind him. They must be close by; they can't be far;<br>
you have your hands on it. Scatter and look for them, dogs! Oh, shiver<br>
my soul,&quot; he cried, &quot;if I had eyes!&quot;<br>
<br>
This appeal seemed to produce some effect, for two of the fellows began<br>
to look here and there among the lumber, but half-heartedly, I thought,<br>
and with half an eye to their own danger all the time, while the rest<br>
stood irresolute on the road.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have your hands on thousands, you fools, and you hang a leg! You'd<br>
be as rich as kings if you could find it, and you know it's here, and<br>
you stand there skulking. There wasn't one of you dared face Bill, and<br>
I did it--a blind man! And I'm to lose my chance for you! I'm to be a<br>
poor, crawling beggar, sponging for <span class=GramE>rum, when</span> I might
be rolling in a<br>
coach! If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch<br>
them still.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hang it, Pew, we've got the doubloons!&quot; grumbled one.<br>
<br>
&quot;They might have <span class=GramE>hid</span> the blessed thing,&quot;
said another. &quot;Take the<br>
Georges, Pew, and don't stand here squalling.&quot;<br>
<br>
Squalling was the word for it; Pew's anger rose so high at these<br>
objections till at last, his passion completely taking the upper hand,<br>
he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded<br>
heavily on more than one.<br>
<br>
These, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant, threatened him<br>
in horrid terms, and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from<br>
his grasp.<br>
<br>
This quarrel was the saving of us, for while it was still raging,<br>
another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the<br>
hamlet--the tramp of horses galloping. Almost at the same time a<br>
pistol-shot, <span class=GramE>flash</span> and report, came from the hedge
side. And that was<br>
plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once<br>
and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one<br>
slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of<br>
them remained but Pew. Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic<br>
or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not; but there he<br>
remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping<br>
and calling for his comrades. Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few<br>
steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, &quot;Johnny, Black Dog, Dirk,&quot;<br>
and other names, &quot;you won't leave old Pew, mates--not old Pew!&quot;<br>
<br>
Just then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders<br>
came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope.<br>
<br>
At this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for<br>
the ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a<br>
second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the<br>
nearest of the coming horses.<br>
<br>
The rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a cry that<br>
rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him<br>
and passed by. He fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face<br>
and moved no more.<br>
<br>
I leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. They were pulling up, at any<br>
rate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they were. One,<br>
tailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to<br>
Dr. Livesey's; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the<br>
way, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once. Some<br>
news of the lugger in Kitt's Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance<br>
and set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance<br>
my mother and I owed our preservation from death.<br>
<br>
Pew was dead, stone dead. As for my mother, when we had carried her up<br>
to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her<br>
back again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still<br>
continued to deplore the balance of the money. In the meantime the<br>
supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt's Hole; but his men<br>
had to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes<br>
supporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was<br>
no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the<br>
lugger was already under way, though still close in. He hailed her. A<br>
voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get<br>
some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his<br>
arm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance<br>
stood there, as he said, &quot;like a fish out of water,&quot; and all he could
do<br>
was to dispatch a man to B---- to warn the cutter. &quot;And that,&quot; said
he,<br>
&quot;is just about as good as nothing. They've got off clean, and there's<br>
an end. Only,&quot; he added, &quot;I'm glad I trod on Master Pew's
corns,&quot; for by<br>
this time he had heard my story.<br>
<br>
I went back with him to the Admiral Benbow, and you cannot imagine a<br>
house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down<br>
by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself;<br>
and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain's<br>
money-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we<br>
were ruined. Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene.<br>
<br>
&quot;They got the money, you say? Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune were<br>
they after? More money, I suppose?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, sir; not money, I think,&quot; replied I. &quot;In fact, sir, I
believe I<br>
have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, I should<br>
like to get it put in safety.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;To be sure, boy; quite right,&quot; said he. &quot;I'll take it, if you
like.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I thought perhaps Dr. Livesey--&quot; I began.<br>
<br>
&quot;Perfectly right,&quot; he interrupted very cheerily, &quot;perfectly
right--a<br>
gentleman and a magistrate. And, now I come to think of it, I might as<br>
well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. Master Pew's<br>
dead, when all's done; not that I regret it, but he's dead, you see, and<br>
people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty's revenue,<br>
if make it out they can. Now, I'll tell you, Hawkins, if you like, I'll<br>
take you along.&quot;<br>
<br>
I thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet<br>
where the horses were. By the time I had told mother of my purpose they<br>
were all in the saddle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dogger,&quot; said Mr. Dance, &quot;you have a good horse; take up this
lad<br>
behind you.&quot;<br>
<br>
As soon as I was mounted, holding on to Dogger's belt, the supervisor<br>
gave the word, and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road<br>
to Dr. Livesey's house.<br>

        <p>1. The riders who arrived at the scene were revenue officers, led by Supervisor Dance. They had received news of the presence of a suspicious lugger in Kitt's Hole and were on their way to investigate. One of the riders was a lad from the hamlet who had informed them of the situation.</p>
        <p>2. During the confrontation, Pew, the blind beggar, was struck at by his own companions in their anger and disagreement. This led to a violent quarrel among the buccaneers, and Pew cursed and struck at them with his stick. As a result of this discord, some of the buccaneers abandoned Pew and ran off in different directions, while others remained at the scene but were disheartened. This internal conflict and Pew's injuries created confusion among the buccaneers and ultimately allowed the revenue officers to arrive and thwart their plans.</p>
        <p>3. When Supervisor Dance and his men arrived at the scene, they encountered chaos and evidence of a violent confrontation. They found Pew, the blind beggar, lying dead on the ground, having been trampled by a horse. The buccaneers had scattered and fled in various directions. Dance's men were unable to catch the escaping buccaneers, but they did manage to confirm that the lugger had set sail and escaped. Dance then decided to return to the hamlet with Jim Hawkins to report the situation and safeguard the money they had recovered from the captain's chest.</p>

<br>
WE rode hard all the way till we drew up before Dr. Livesey's door. The<br>
house was all dark to the front.<br>
<br>
Mr. Dance told me to jump down and knock, and Dogger gave me a stirrup<br>
to descend by. The door was opened almost at once by the maid.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is Dr. Livesey in?&quot; I asked.<br>
<br>
No, she said, he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the<br>
hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire.<br>
<br>
&quot;So there we go, boys,&quot; said Mr. Dance.<br>
<br>
This time, as the distance was short, I did not mount, but ran with<br>
Dogger's stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long, leafless,<br>
moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on<br>
either hand on great old gardens. Here Mr. Dance dismounted, and taking<br>
me along with him, was admitted at a word into the house.<br>
<br>
The servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a<br>
great library, all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them,<br>
where the squire and Dr. Livesey sat, pipe in hand, on either side of a<br>
bright fire.<br>
<br>
I had never seen the squire so near at hand. He was a tall man, over six<br>
feet high, and broad in proportion, and he had a bluff, rough-and-ready<br>
face, all roughened and reddened and lined in his long travels. His<br>
eyebrows were very black, and moved readily, and this gave him a look of<br>
some temper, not bad, you would say, but quick and high.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come in, Mr. Dance,&quot; says he, very stately and condescending.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good evening, Dance,&quot; says the doctor with a nod. &quot;And good
evening to<br>
you, friend Jim. What good wind brings you here?&quot;<br>
<br>
The supervisor stood up straight and stiff and told his story like a<br>
lesson; and you should have seen how the two gentlemen leaned forward<br>
and looked at <span class=GramE>each other, and</span> forgot to smoke in their
surprise and<br>
interest. When they heard how my mother went back to the inn, Dr.<br>
Livesey fairly slapped his thigh, and the squire cried &quot;Bravo!&quot; and<br>
broke his long pipe against the grate. Long before it was done, Mr.<br>
Trelawney (that, you will remember, was the squire's name) had got up<br>
from his seat and was striding about the room, and the doctor, as if to<br>
hear the better, had taken off his powdered wig and sat there looking<br>
very strange indeed with his own close-cropped black poll.<br>
<br>
At last Mr. Dance finished the story.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mr. Dance,&quot; said the squire, &quot;you are a very noble fellow. And
as for<br>
riding down that black, atrocious miscreant, I regard it as an act of<br>
virtue, sir, like stamping on a cockroach. This lad Hawkins is a trump,<br>
I perceive. Hawkins, will you ring that bell? Mr. Dance must have some<br>
ale.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And so, Jim,&quot; said the doctor, &quot;you have the thing that they
were<br>
after, have you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Here it is, sir,&quot; said I, and gave him the oilskin packet.<br>
<br>
The doctor looked it all over, as if his fingers were itching to open<br>
it; but instead of doing that, he put it quietly in the pocket of his<br>
coat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Squire,&quot; said he, &quot;when Dance has had his ale he must, of
course, be<br>
off on his Majesty's service; but I mean to keep Jim Hawkins here to<br>
sleep at my house, and with your permission, I propose we should have up<br>
the cold pie and let him <span class=SpellE>sup</span>.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As you will, Livesey,&quot; said the squire; &quot;Hawkins has earned
better than<br>
cold pie.&quot;<br>
<br>
So a big pigeon pie was brought in and put on a <span class=SpellE>sidetable</span>,
and I made<br>
a hearty supper, for I was as hungry as a hawk, while Mr. Dance was<br>
further complimented and at last dismissed.<br>
<br>
&quot;And now, squire,&quot; said the doctor.<br>
<br>
&quot;And now, Livesey,&quot; said the squire in the same breath.<br>
<br>
&quot;One at a time, one at a time,&quot; laughed Dr. Livesey. &quot;You have
heard of<br>
this Flint, I suppose?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Heard of him!&quot; cried the squire. &quot;Heard of him, you say! He was
the<br>
<span class=SpellE>bloodthirstiest</span> buccaneer that sailed. Blackbeard was
a child to Flint.<br>
The Spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that, I tell you, sir,<br>
I was sometimes proud he was an Englishman. I've seen his <span class=GramE>top-sails</span>
with<br>
these eyes, off Trinidad, and the cowardly son of a rum-puncheon that I<br>
sailed with put back--put back, sir, into Port of Spain.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I've heard of him myself, in England,&quot; said the doctor.
&quot;But the<br>
point is, had he money?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Money!&quot; cried the squire. &quot;Have you heard the story? What were
these<br>
villains after but money? What do they care for but money? For what<br>
would they risk their rascal carcasses but money?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That we shall soon know,&quot; replied the doctor. &quot;But you are so<br>
confoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that I cannot get a word in.<br>
What I want to know is this: Supposing that I have here in my pocket<br>
some clue to where Flint buried his treasure, will that treasure amount<br>
to much?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Amount, sir!&quot; cried the squire. &quot;It will amount to this: If we
have the<br>
clue you talk about, I fit out a ship in Bristol dock, and take you and<br>
Hawkins here along, and I'll have that treasure if I search a year.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well,&quot; said the doctor. &quot;Now, then, if Jim is agreeable,
we'll<br>
open the packet&quot;; and he laid it before him on the table.<br>
<br>
The bundle was sewn together, and the doctor had to get out his<br>
instrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors. It<br>
contained two things--a book and a sealed paper.<br>
<br>
&quot;First of all we'll try the book,&quot; observed the doctor.<br>
<br>
The squire and I were both peering over his shoulder as he opened<br>
it, for Dr. Livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the<br>
side-table, where I had been eating, to enjoy the sport of the search.<br>
On the first page there were only some scraps of writing, such as a man<br>
with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice. One was the<br>
same as the tattoo mark, &quot;Billy Bones his fancy&quot;; then there was
&quot;Mr. W.<br>
Bones, mate,&quot; &quot;No more rum,&quot; &quot;Off Palm Key he got <span
class=SpellE>itt</span>,&quot; and some other<br>
snatches, mostly single words and unintelligible. I could not help<br>
wondering who it was that had &quot;got <span class=SpellE>itt</span>,&quot;
and what &quot;<span class=SpellE>itt</span>&quot; was that he got.<br>
A knife in his back as like as not.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not much instruction there,&quot; said Dr. Livesey as he passed on.<br>
<br>
The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of<br>
entries. There was a date at one end of the line and at the other a<br>
sum of money, as in common account-books, but instead of explanatory<br>
writing, only a varying number of crosses between the two. On the 12th<br>
of <span class=GramE>June,</span> 1745, for instance, a sum of seventy pounds
had plainly become<br>
due to someone, and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the<br>
cause. In a few cases, to be sure, the name of a place would be added,<br>
as &quot;Offe Caraccas,&quot; or a mere entry of latitude and longitude, as
&quot;62o<br>
17' 20&quot;, 19o 2' 40&quot;.&quot;<br>
<br>
The record lasted over nearly twenty years, the amount of the separate<br>
entries growing larger as time went on, and at the end a grand total<br>
had been made out after five or six wrong additions, and these words<br>
appended, &quot;Bones, his pile.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't make head or tail of this,&quot; said Dr. Livesey.<br>
<br>
&quot;The thing is as clear as noonday,&quot; cried the squire. &quot;This is
the<br>
black-hearted hound's account-book. These crosses stand for the names of<br>
ships or towns that they sank or plundered. The sums are the scoundrel's<br>
share, and where he feared an ambiguity, you see he added something<br>
clearer. 'Offe Caraccas,' now; you see, here was some unhappy vessel<br>
boarded off that coast. God help the poor souls that manned her--coral<br>
long ago.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Right!&quot; said the doctor. &quot;See what it is to be a traveller.
Right! And<br>
the amounts increase, you see, as he rose in rank.&quot;<br>
<br>
There was little else in the <span class=GramE>volume</span> but a few bearings
of places noted<br>
in the blank leaves towards the end and a table for reducing French,<br>
English, and Spanish moneys to a common value.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thrifty man!&quot; cried the doctor. &quot;He wasn't the one to be
cheated.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And now,&quot; said the squire, &quot;for the other.&quot;<br>
<br>
The paper had been sealed in several places with a thimble by way of<br>
seal; the very thimble, perhaps, that I had found in the captain's<br>
pocket. The doctor opened the seals with great care, and there fell out<br>
the map of an island, with latitude and longitude, soundings, names of<br>
hills and bays and inlets, and every <span class=GramE>particular that</span>
would be needed<br>
to bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its shores. It was about nine<br>
miles long and five across, shaped, you might say, like a fat dragon<br>
standing up, and had two fine land-locked harbours, and a hill in the<br>
centre part marked &quot;The <span class=GramE>Spy-glass</span>.&quot; There
were several additions of a<br>
later date, but above all, three crosses of red ink--two on the north<br>
part of the island, one in the southwest--and beside this last, in<br>
the same red ink, and in a small, neat hand, very different from the<br>
captain's tottery characters, these words: &quot;Bulk of treasure here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Over on the back the same hand had written this further information:<br>
<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Tall tree, Spy-glass shoulder,
bearing a point to<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>the N. of N.N.E.<br>
<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Skeleton Island E.S.E. and by E.<br>
<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Ten feet.<br>
<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>The bar silver is in the north cache;
you can find<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>it by the trend of the east hummock,
ten fathoms<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>south of the black crag with the
face on it.<br>
<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>The arms are easy found, in the
sand-hill, N.<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>point of north inlet cape, bearing
E. and a<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>quarter N.<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>J.F.<br>
<br>
That was all; but brief as it was, and to me incomprehensible, it filled<br>
the squire and Dr. Livesey with delight.<br>
<br>
&quot;Livesey,&quot; said the squire, &quot;you will give up this wretched
practice<br>
at once. <span class=GramE>Tomorrow</span> I start for Bristol. In three weeks'
time--three<br>
<span class=GramE>weeks!--</span>two weeks--ten days--we'll have the best ship,
sir, and the<br>
choicest crew in England. Hawkins shall come as cabin-boy. You'll make<br>
a famous cabin-boy, Hawkins. You, Livesey, are ship's doctor; I am<br>
admiral. We'll take Redruth, Joyce, and Hunter. We'll have favourable<br>
winds, a quick passage, and not the least difficulty in finding the<br>
spot, and money to eat, to roll in, to play duck and drake with ever<br>
after.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Trelawney,&quot; said the doctor, &quot;I'll go with you; and I'll go
bail for<br>
it, so will Jim, and be a credit to the undertaking. There's only one<br>
man I'm afraid of.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And who's that?&quot; cried the squire. &quot;Name the dog, sir!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You,&quot; replied the doctor; &quot;for you cannot hold your tongue. We
are not<br>
the only men who know of this paper. These fellows who attacked the<br>
inn tonight--bold, desperate blades, for sure--and the rest who stayed<br>
aboard that lugger, and more, I dare say, not far off, are, one and all,<br>
through thick and thin, bound that they'll get that money. We must none<br>
of us go alone till we get to sea. Jim and I shall stick together in the<br>
meanwhile; you'll take Joyce and Hunter when you ride to Bristol, and<br>
from first to last, not one of us must breathe a word of what we've<br>
found.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Livesey,&quot; returned the squire, &quot;you are always in the right of
it. I'll<br>
be as silent as the grave.&quot;<br>

        <p>1. The book found in the sealed packet contained entries related to financial transactions and accounts. It included dates, sums of money, and a series of crosses that seemed to represent names of ships or places that had been plundered. These entries spanned nearly twenty years and appeared to document the activities and earnings of a pirate or buccaneer. Additionally, there were some other snippets of writing, such as "Billy Bones his fancy" and "Mr. W. Bones, mate," but the entries were mostly cryptic and unintelligible.</p>
        <p>2. The sealed paper inside the packet contained a map of an island. The map included details such as latitude and longitude, soundings, names of hills, bays, and inlets, and other navigational information. It described the island as approximately nine miles long and five miles across, with two land-locked harbors. The map indicated a hill in the center called "The Spy-glass." Notably, there were three red crosses marked on the map, two in the north part of the island and one in the southwest, with a note in small, neat handwriting that read, "Bulk of treasure here." On the back of the paper, there were additional instructions about finding the treasure, including references to landmarks, compass bearings, and distances.</p>
        <p>3. Both the squire and Dr. Livesey were delighted and excited by the discovery of the map and its information. The squire immediately made plans to set sail for Bristol with a well-equipped ship and crew to search for the treasure indicated on the map. He was eager to embark on the adventure and believed they would be successful. Dr. Livesey, while expressing willingness to join the expedition, cautioned the squire about the need for secrecy. He emphasized that others might also be aware of the treasure map, including the attackers who had targeted the inn earlier, and they should not reveal their intentions to anyone until they were at sea.</p>
