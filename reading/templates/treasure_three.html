<br>
THE appearance of the island when I came on deck next morning was<br>
altogether changed. Although the breeze had now utterly ceased, we had<br>
made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed<br>
about half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast.<br>
Grey-coloured woods covered a large part of the surface. This even tint<br>
was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand-break in the lower lands,<br>
and by many tall trees of the pine family, out-topping the others--some<br>
singly, some in clumps; but the general colouring was uniform and sad.<br>
The hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock.<br>
All were strangely shaped, and the Spy-glass, which was by three or four<br>
hundred feet the tallest on the island, was likewise the strangest in<br>
configuration, running up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly<br>
cut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on.<br>
<br>
The HISPANIOLA was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell. The booms<br>
were tearing at the blocks, the rudder was banging to and <span class=SpellE>fro</span>,
and the<br>
whole ship creaking, groaning, and jumping like a manufactory. I had<br>
to cling tight to the backstay, and the world turned giddily before my<br>
eyes, for though I was a good enough sailor when there was way on, this<br>
standing still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing I never<br>
learned to stand without a qualm or so, above all in the morning, on an<br>
empty stomach.<br>
<br>
Perhaps it was this--perhaps it was the look of the island, with its<br>
grey, melancholy woods, and wild stone spires, and the surf that we<br>
could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach--at<br>
least, although the sun shone bright and hot, and the shore birds were<br>
fishing and crying all around us, and you would have thought anyone<br>
would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea, my heart<br>
sank, as the saying is, into my boots; and from the first look onward, I<br>
hated the very thought of Treasure Island.<br>
<br>
We had a dreary morning's work before us, for there was no sign of any<br>
wind, and the boats had to be got out and manned, and the ship warped<br>
three or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow<br>
passage to the haven behind Skeleton Island. I volunteered for one of<br>
the boats, where I had, of course, no business. The heat was sweltering,<br>
and the men grumbled fiercely over their work. Anderson was in command<br>
of my boat, and instead of keeping the crew in order, he grumbled as<br>
loud as the worst.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; he said with an oath, &quot;it's not forever.&quot;<br>
<br>
I thought this was a very bad sign, for up to that day the men had gone<br>
briskly and willingly about their business; but the very sight of the<br>
island had relaxed the cords of discipline.<br>
<br>
All the way in, Long John stood by the steersman and conned the ship.<br>
He knew the passage like the palm of his hand, and though the man in the<br>
chains got everywhere more water than was down in the chart, John never<br>
hesitated once.<br>
<br>
&quot;There's a strong scour with the ebb,&quot; he said, &quot;and this here
passage<br>
has been dug out, in a manner of speaking, with a spade.&quot;<br>
<br>
We brought up just where the anchor was in the chart, about a third of<br>
a mile from each shore, the mainland on one side and Skeleton Island on<br>
the other. The bottom was clean sand. The plunge of our anchor sent up<br>
clouds of birds wheeling and crying over the woods, but in less than a<br>
minute they were down again and all was once more silent.<br>
<br>
The place was entirely land-locked, buried in woods, the trees coming<br>
right down to high-water mark, the shores mostly flat, and the hilltops<br>
standing round at a distance in a sort of amphitheatre, one here, one<br>
there. Two little rivers, or rather two swamps, emptied out into this<br>
pond, as you might call it; and the foliage round that part of the shore<br>
had a kind of poisonous brightness. From the ship we could see nothing<br>
of the house or stockade, for they were quite buried among trees; and if<br>
it had not been for the chart on the companion, we might have been the<br>
first that had ever anchored there since the island arose out of the<br>
seas.<br>
<br>
There was not a breath of air moving, nor a sound but that of the<br>
surf booming half a mile away along the beaches and against the rocks<br>
outside. A peculiar stagnant smell hung over the anchorage--a smell of<br>
sodden leaves and rotting tree trunks. I observed the doctor sniffing<br>
and sniffing, like someone tasting a bad egg.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know about treasure,&quot; he said, &quot;but I'll stake my wig
there's<br>
fever here.&quot;<br>
<br>
If the conduct of the men had been alarming in the boat, it became truly<br>
threatening when they had come aboard. They lay about the deck growling<br>
together in talk. The slightest order was received with a black look and<br>
grudgingly and carelessly obeyed. Even the honest hands must have caught<br>
the infection, for there was not one man aboard to mend another. Mutiny,<br>
it was plain, hung over us like a <span class=GramE>thunder-cloud</span>.<br>
<br>
And it was not only we of the cabin party who perceived the danger. Long<br>
John was hard at work going from group to group, spending himself in<br>
good advice, and as for example no man could have shown a better. He<br>
fairly outstripped himself in willingness and civility; he was all<br>
smiles to everyone. If an order were given, John would be on his crutch<br>
in an instant, with the cheeriest &quot;Aye, aye, sir!&quot; in the world; and<br>
when there was nothing else to do, he kept up one song after another, as<br>
if to conceal the discontent of the rest.<br>
<br>
Of all the gloomy features of that gloomy afternoon, this obvious<br>
anxiety on the part of Long John appeared the worst.<br>
<br>
We held a council in the cabin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir,&quot; said the captain, &quot;if I risk another order, the whole <span
class=SpellE>ship'll</span><br>
come about our ears by the run. You see, sir, here it is. I get a rough<br>
answer, do I not? Well, if I speak back, pikes will be going in two<br>
shakes; if I don't, Silver will see there's something under that, and<br>
the game's up. Now, we've only one man to rely on.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And who is that?&quot; asked the squire.<br>
<br>
&quot;Silver, sir,&quot; returned the captain; &quot;he's as anxious as you and
<span class=GramE>I</span> to<br>
smother things up. This is a tiff; he'd soon talk '<span class=SpellE>em</span>
out of it if he<br>
had the chance, and what I propose to do is to give him the chance.<br>
Let's allow the men an afternoon ashore. If they all go, why we'll fight<br>
the ship. If they none of them go, well then, we hold the cabin, and God<br>
defend the right. If some go, you mark my words, sir, <span class=SpellE>Silver'll</span>
bring<br>
'<span class=SpellE>em</span> aboard again as mild as lambs.&quot;<br>
<br>
It was so decided; loaded pistols were served out to all the sure men;<br>
Hunter, Joyce, and Redruth were taken into our confidence and received<br>
the news with less surprise and a better spirit than we had looked for,<br>
and then the captain went on deck and addressed the crew.<br>
<br>
&quot;My lads,&quot; said he, &quot;we've had a hot day and are all tired and
out of<br>
sorts. A turn <span class=SpellE>ashore'll</span> hurt nobody--the boats are
still in the water;<br>
you can take the gigs, and as many as please may go ashore for the<br>
afternoon. I'll fire a gun half an hour before sundown.&quot;<br>
<br>
I believe the silly fellows must have thought they would break their<br>
shins over treasure as soon as they were landed, for they all came out<br>
of their sulks in a moment and gave a cheer that started the echo in a<br>
faraway hill and sent the birds once more flying and squalling round the<br>
anchorage.<br>
<br>
The captain was too bright to be in the way. He whipped out of sight<br>
in a moment, leaving Silver to arrange the party, and I fancy it was as<br>
well he did so. Had he been on deck, he could no longer so much as<br>
have pretended not to understand the situation. It was as plain as day.<br>
Silver was the captain, and a mighty rebellious crew he had of it. The<br>
honest hands--and I was soon to see it proved that there were such on<br>
board--must have been very stupid fellows. Or rather, I suppose the<br>
truth was this, that all hands were disaffected by the example of the<br>
ringleaders--only some more, some less; and a few, being good fellows in<br>
the main, could neither be led nor driven any further. It is one thing<br>
to be idle and skulk and quite another to take a ship and murder a<br>
number of innocent men.<br>
<br>
At last, however, the party was made up. Six fellows were to stay on<br>
board, and the remaining thirteen, including Silver, began to embark.<br>
<br>
Then it was that there came into my head the first of the mad notions<br>
that contributed so much to save our lives. If six men were left by<br>
Silver, it was plain our party could not take and fight the ship; and<br>
since only six were left, it was equally plain that the cabin party<br>
had no present need of my assistance. It occurred to me at once to go<br>
ashore. In a jiffy I had slipped over the side and curled up in the<br>
<span class=GramE>fore-sheets</span> of the nearest boat, and almost at the
same moment she<br>
shoved off.<br>
<br>
No one took notice of me, only the bow oar saying, &quot;Is that you, Jim?<br>
Keep your head down.&quot; But Silver, from the other boat, looked sharply<br>
over and called out to know if that were me; and from that moment I<br>
began to regret what I had done.<br>
<br>
The crews raced for the beach, but the boat I was in, having some start<br>
and being at once the lighter and the better manned, shot far ahead of<br>
her consort, and the bow had struck among the shore-side trees and I<br>
had caught a branch and swung myself out and plunged into the nearest<br>
thicket while Silver and the rest were still a hundred yards behind.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jim, Jim!&quot; I heard him shouting.<br>
<br>
But you may suppose I paid no heed; jumping, ducking, and breaking<br>
through, I ran straight before my nose till I could run no longer.<br>

        <p>1. When Jim Hawkins comes on deck, he sees that the appearance of the island has changed dramatically. The ship has come to a halt about half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast of the island. The island is covered with grey-colored woods, broken up by streaks of yellow sand in the lower lands. Tall trees of the pine family are visible, some singly and some in clumps. The hills on the island are strangely shaped, with spires of naked rock rising above the vegetation. The Spy-glass hill, the tallest on the island, has a unique and peculiar configuration, rising almost sheer from every side and then being suddenly cut off at the top like a pedestal.</p>
        <p>2. Jim Hawkins has a sinking feeling about Treasure Island despite its pleasant surroundings because the appearance of the island's landscape, with its grey and melancholy woods, wild stone spires, and the sound of the surf foaming on the beach, makes him feel uneasy and anxious. Even though the sun is shining brightly and shore birds are present, he experiences a sense of dread and discomfort about the island. The island's eerie and foreboding atmosphere contrasts with the idea of treasure, creating a sense of foreboding.</p>
        <p>3. Captain Smollett plans to handle the situation by allowing the crew to go ashore for the afternoon. He proposes to give them an opportunity to relax and spend time on the island, hoping that this will improve their mood and prevent a mutiny. Smollett realizes that the crew's morale is deteriorating, and he fears that if he gives any more orders or pushes the crew too hard, it could lead to a mutiny. By allowing them some freedom and a break from their duties, he hopes to defuse the tension and maintain control of the situation.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>14. The First Blow</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
        <br>
I WAS so pleased at having given the slip to Long John that I began to<br>
enjoy myself and look around me with some interest on the strange land<br>
that I was in.<br>
<br>
I had crossed a marshy tract full of willows, bulrushes, and odd,<br>
outlandish, swampy trees; and I had now come out upon the skirts of an<br>
open piece of undulating, sandy country, about a mile long, dotted with<br>
a few pines and a great number of contorted trees, not unlike the oak<br>
in growth, but pale in the foliage, like willows. On the far side of<br>
the open stood one of the hills, with two quaint, craggy peaks shining<br>
vividly in the sun.<br>
<br>
I now felt for the first time the joy of exploration. The isle was<br>
uninhabited; my shipmates I had left behind, and nothing lived in front<br>
of me but dumb brutes and fowls. I turned hither and thither among the<br>
trees. Here and there were flowering plants, unknown to me; here and<br>
there I saw snakes, and one raised his head from a ledge of rock and<br>
hissed at me with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top. Little did<br>
I suppose that he was a deadly enemy and that the noise was the famous<br>
rattle.<br>
<br>
Then I came to a long thicket of these <span class=SpellE>oaklike</span>
trees--live, or<br>
evergreen, oaks, I heard afterwards they should be called--which grew<br>
low along the sand like brambles, the boughs curiously twisted, the<br>
foliage compact, like thatch. The thicket stretched down from the top of<br>
one of the sandy knolls, spreading and growing taller as it went, until<br>
it reached the margin of the broad, reedy fen, through which the nearest<br>
of the little rivers soaked its way into the anchorage. The marsh was<br>
steaming in the strong sun, and the outline of the <span class=GramE>Spy-glass</span>
trembled<br>
through the haze.<br>
<br>
All at once there began to go a sort of bustle among the bulrushes;<br>
a wild duck flew up with a quack, another followed, and soon over the<br>
whole surface of the marsh a great cloud of birds hung screaming and<br>
circling in the air. I judged at once that some of my shipmates must be<br>
drawing near along the borders of the fen. Nor was I deceived, for soon<br>
I heard the very distant and low tones of a human voice, which, as I<br>
continued to give ear, grew steadily louder and nearer.<br>
<br>
This put me in a great fear, and I crawled under cover of the nearest<br>
live-oak and squatted there, hearkening, as silent as a mouse.<br>
<br>
Another voice answered, and then the first voice, which I now recognized<br>
to be Silver's, once more took up the story and ran on for a long while<br>
in a stream, only now and again interrupted by the other. By the sound<br>
they must have been talking earnestly, and almost fiercely; but no<br>
distinct word came to my hearing.<br>
<br>
At last the speakers seemed to have paused and perhaps to have sat down,<br>
for not only did they cease to draw any nearer, but the birds themselves<br>
began to grow more quiet and to settle again to their places in the<br>
swamp.<br>
<br>
And now I began to feel that I was neglecting my business, that since<br>
I had been so foolhardy as to come ashore with these desperadoes, the<br>
least I could do was to overhear them at their councils, and that my<br>
plain and obvious duty was to draw as close as I could manage, under the<br>
favourable ambush of the crouching trees.<br>
<br>
I could tell the direction of the speakers pretty exactly, not only by<br>
the sound of their voices but by the behaviour of the few birds that<br>
still hung in alarm above the heads of the intruders.<br>
<br>
Crawling on all fours, I made steadily but slowly towards them, till at<br>
last, raising my head to an aperture among the leaves, I could see clear<br>
down into a little green dell beside the marsh, and closely set about<br>
with trees, where Long John Silver and another of the crew stood face to<br>
face in conversation.<br>
<br>
The sun beat full upon them. Silver had thrown his hat beside him on the<br>
ground, and his great, smooth, blond face, all shining with heat, was<br>
lifted to the other <span class=GramE>man's</span> in a kind of appeal.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mate,&quot; he was saying, &quot;it's because I thinks gold dust of
you--gold<br>
dust, and you may lay to that! If I hadn't took to you like pitch, do<br>
you think I'd have been here a-warning of you? All's up--you can't make<br>
nor mend; it's to save your neck that I'm a-speaking, and if one of the<br>
wild <span class=SpellE>uns</span> knew it, where'd I be, Tom--now, tell me,
where'd I be?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Silver,&quot; said the other man--and I observed he was not only red in
the<br>
face, but spoke as hoarse as a crow, and his voice shook too, like a<br>
taut rope--&quot;Silver,&quot; says he, &quot;you're old, and you're honest, or
has the<br>
name for it; and you've money too, which lots of poor sailors hasn't;<br>
and you're brave, or I'm mistook. And will you tell me you'll let<br>
yourself be led away with that kind of a mess of swabs? Not you! As sure<br>
as God sees me, I'd sooner lose my hand. If I turn <span class=SpellE>agin</span>
my <span class=SpellE>dooty</span>--&quot;<br>
<br>
And then all of a <span class=GramE>sudden</span> he was interrupted by a
noise. I had found<br>
one of the honest hands--well, here, at that same moment, came news of<br>
another. Far away out in the marsh there arose, <span class=GramE>all of a
sudden</span>, a sound<br>
like the cry of anger, then another on the back of it; and then one<br>
horrid, long-drawn scream. The rocks of the Spy-glass re-echoed it a<br>
score of times; the whole troop of marsh-birds rose again, darkening<br>
heaven, with a simultaneous whirr; and long after that death yell was<br>
still ringing in my brain, silence had re-established its empire, and<br>
only the rustle of the redescending birds and the boom of the distant<br>
surges disturbed the languor of the afternoon.<br>
<br>
Tom had leaped at the sound, like a horse at the spur, but Silver had<br>
not winked an eye. He stood where he was, resting lightly on his crutch,<br>
watching his companion like a snake about to spring.<br>
<br>
&quot;John!&quot; said the sailor, stretching out his hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hands off!&quot; cried Silver, leaping back a yard, as it seemed to me,
with<br>
the speed and security of a trained gymnast.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hands off, if you like, John Silver,&quot; said the other. &quot;It's a
black<br>
conscience that can make you feared of me. But in heaven's name, tell<br>
me, what was that?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That?&quot; returned Silver, smiling away, but warier than ever, his eye<br>
a mere <span class=GramE>pin-point</span> in his big face, but gleaming like a
crumb of glass.<br>
&quot;That? Oh, I reckon that'll be Alan.&quot;<br>
<br>
And at this point Tom flashed out like a hero.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alan!&quot; he cried. &quot;Then rest his soul for a true seaman! And as
for you,<br>
John Silver, long you've been a mate of mine, but you're mate of mine<br>
no more. If I die like a dog, I'll die in my <span class=SpellE>dooty</span>.
You've killed Alan,<br>
have you? Kill me <span class=GramE>too, if</span> you can. But I <span
class=GramE>defies</span> you.&quot;<br>
<br>
And with that, this brave fellow turned his back directly on the cook<br>
and set off walking for the beach. But he was not destined to go far.<br>
With a cry John seized the branch of a tree, whipped the crutch out of<br>
his armpit, and sent that uncouth missile hurtling through the air.<br>
It struck poor Tom, point foremost, and with stunning violence, right<br>
between the shoulders in the middle of his back. His hands flew up, he<br>
gave a sort of gasp, and fell.<br>
<br>
Whether he <span class=GramE>were</span> injured much or little, none could
ever tell. Like<br>
enough, to judge from the sound, his back was broken on the spot. But he<br>
had no time given him to recover. Silver, agile as a monkey even without<br>
leg or crutch, was on the top of him next moment and had twice buried<br>
his knife up to the hilt in that defenceless body. From my place of<br>
ambush, I could hear him pant aloud as he struck the blows.<br>
<br>
I do not know what it rightly is to faint, but I do know that for the<br>
next little while the whole world swam away from before me in a whirling<br>
mist; Silver and the birds, and the tall Spy-glass hilltop, going<br>
round and round and topsy-turvy before my eyes, and all manner of bells<br>
ringing and distant voices shouting in my ear.<br>
<br>
When I came again to myself the monster had pulled himself together,<br>
his crutch under his arm, his hat upon his head. Just before him Tom<br>
lay motionless upon the sward; but the murderer minded him not a whit,<br>
cleansing his blood-stained knife the while upon a wisp of grass.<br>
Everything else was unchanged, the sun still shining mercilessly on the<br>
steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain, and I could scarce<br>
persuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life<br>
cruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes.<br>
<br>
But now John put his hand into his pocket, brought out a whistle, and<br>
blew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated<br>
air. I could not tell, of course, the meaning of the signal, but<br>
it instantly awoke my fears. More men would be coming. I might be<br>
discovered. They had already slain two of the honest people; after Tom<br>
and Alan, might not I come next?<br>
<br>
Instantly I began to extricate myself and crawl back again, with what<br>
speed and silence I could manage, to the more open portion of the<br>
wood. As I did so, I could hear hails coming and going between the old<br>
buccaneer and his comrades, and this sound of danger lent me wings. As<br>
soon as I was clear of the thicket, I ran as I never ran before, scarce<br>
minding the direction of my flight, so long as it led me from the<br>
murderers; and as I ran, fear grew and grew upon me until it turned into<br>
a kind of frenzy.<br>
<br>
Indeed, could anyone be more entirely lost than I? When the gun fired,<br>
how should I dare to go down to the boats among those fiends, still<br>
smoking from their crime? Would not the first of them who saw me wring<br>
my neck like a snipe's? Would not my absence itself be <span class=GramE>an evidence</span>
to<br>
them of my alarm, and therefore of my fatal knowledge? It was all over,<br>
I thought. Good-bye to the HISPANIOLA; good-bye to the squire, the<br>
doctor, and the captain! There was nothing left for me but death by<br>
starvation or death by the hands of the mutineers.<br>
<br>
All this while, as I say, I was still running, and without taking any<br>
notice, I had drawn near to the foot of the little hill with the two<br>
peaks and had got into a part of the island where the live-oaks grew<br>
more widely apart and seemed more like forest trees in their bearing and<br>
dimensions. Mingled with these were a few scattered pines, some fifty,<br>
some nearer seventy, feet high. The air too smelt more freshly than down<br>
beside the marsh.<br>
<br>

        <p>1. As Jim Hawkins explores the island, he first crosses a marshy tract filled with willows, bulrushes, and odd swampy trees. He then enters an open, sandy area about a mile long, dotted with a few pine trees and many contorted trees that resemble oaks but have pale foliage like willows. In the distance, he sees one of the hills with two craggy peaks. The landscape is undulating, and the marsh is steaming in the strong sun.</p>
        <p>2. The sounds of wild ducks flying up with quacks and other birds circling and screaming in the marsh indicate to Jim Hawkins that some of his shipmates are drawing near along the borders of the fen. He becomes fearful upon hearing the human voices in the distance and decides to hide and listen to their conversation, thinking it is his duty to overhear them at their councils.</p>
        <p>3. Long John Silver and Tom have a confrontation in which Silver is trying to persuade Tom to join him. Tom refuses to be led away and insists on doing his duty. Suddenly, a noise interrupts them, and there is a scream in the marsh. Tom, startled, turns to leave for the beach, but Silver throws his crutch at him, striking him between the shoulders with stunning force. Tom falls, and Silver, agile despite his disability, approaches him and brutally stabs him with a knife, killing him. Tom's sudden movement and reaction to the scream likely startled Silver, leading to his violent response.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>15. The Man of the Island</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
        <br>
FROM the side of the hill, which was here steep and stony, a spout of<br>
gravel was dislodged and fell rattling and bounding through the trees.<br>
My eyes turned instinctively in that direction, and I saw a figure leap<br>
with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine. What it was, whether<br>
bear or man or monkey, I could in no wise tell. It seemed dark and<br>
shaggy; more I knew not. But the terror of this new apparition brought<br>
me to a stand.<br>
<br>
I was now, it seemed, cut off upon both sides; behind me the murderers,<br>
before me this lurking nondescript. And immediately I began to prefer<br>
the dangers that I knew to those I knew not. Silver himself appeared<br>
less terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods, and I turned<br>
on my heel, and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder, began to<br>
retrace my steps in the direction of the boats.<br>
<br>
Instantly the figure reappeared, and making a wide circuit, began to<br>
head me off. I was tired, at any rate; but had I been as fresh as when I<br>
rose, I could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an<br>
adversary. From trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer, running<br>
manlike on two legs, but unlike any man that I had ever seen, stooping<br>
almost double as it ran. Yet a man it was, I could no longer be in doubt<br>
about that.<br>
<br>
I began to recall what I had heard of cannibals. I was within an ace of<br>
calling for help. But the mere fact that he was a man, however wild,<br>
had somewhat reassured me, and my fear of Silver began to revive in<br>
proportion. I stood still, therefore, and cast about for some method of<br>
escape; and as I was so thinking, the recollection of my pistol flashed<br>
into my mind. As soon as I remembered I was not defenceless, courage<br>
glowed again in my heart and I set my face resolutely for this man of<br>
the island and walked briskly towards him.<br>
<br>
He was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk; but he must<br>
have been watching me closely, for as soon as I began to move in his<br>
direction he reappeared and took a step to meet me. Then he hesitated,<br>
drew back, came forward again, and at last, to my wonder and<br>
confusion, threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in<br>
supplication.<br>
<br>
At that I once more stopped.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you?&quot; I asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ben Gunn,&quot; he answered, and his voice sounded hoarse and awkward,<br>
like a rusty lock. &quot;I'm poor Ben Gunn, I <span class=GramE>am;</span> and
I haven't <span class=SpellE>spoke</span> with a<br>
Christian these three years.&quot;<br>
<br>
I could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his<br>
features were even pleasing. His skin, wherever it was exposed, was<br>
burnt by the sun; even his lips were black, and his fair eyes looked<br>
quite startling in so dark a face. Of all the <span class=GramE>beggar-men</span>
that I had seen<br>
or fancied, he was the chief for raggedness. He was clothed with tatters<br>
of old ship's canvas and old sea-cloth, and this extraordinary patchwork<br>
was all held together by a system of the most various and incongruous<br>
fastenings, brass buttons, bits of stick, and loops of tarry gaskin.<br>
About his waist he wore an old brass-buckled leather belt, which was the<br>
one thing solid in his whole accoutrement.<br>
<br>
&quot;Three years!&quot; I cried. &quot;Were you shipwrecked?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nay, mate,&quot; said he; &quot;marooned.&quot;<br>
<br>
I had heard the word, and I knew it stood for a horrible kind of<br>
punishment common enough among the buccaneers, in which the offender<br>
is put ashore with a little powder and shot and left behind on some<br>
desolate and distant island.<br>
<br>
&quot;Marooned three years agone,&quot; he continued, &quot;and lived on goats
since<br>
then, and berries, and oysters. Wherever a man is, says I, a man can<br>
do for himself. But, mate, my heart is sore for Christian diet. You<br>
mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now? No? Well,<br>
<span class=SpellE>many's</span> the long night I've dreamed of
cheese--toasted, mostly--and woke<br>
up again, and here I were.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If ever I can get aboard again,&quot; said I, &quot;you shall have cheese
by the<br>
stone.&quot;<br>
<br>
All this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket, smoothing<br>
my hands, looking at my boots, and generally, in the intervals of<br>
his speech, showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow<br>
creature. But at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled<br>
slyness.<br>
<br>
&quot;If ever you can get aboard again, says you?&quot; he repeated. &quot;Why,
now,<br>
who's to hinder you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not you, I know,&quot; was my reply.<br>
<br>
&quot;And right you <span class=GramE>was</span>,&quot; he cried. &quot;Now
you--what do you call yourself,<br>
mate?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Jim,&quot; I told him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jim, Jim,&quot; says he, quite pleased apparently. &quot;Well, now, Jim,
I've<br>
lived that rough as you'd be ashamed to hear of. Now, for instance, you<br>
wouldn't think I had had a pious mother--to look at me?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, no, not in particular,&quot; I answered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, well,&quot; said he, &quot;but I had--remarkable pious. And I was a
civil,<br>
pious boy, and could rattle off my catechism that fast, as you couldn't<br>
tell one word from another. And here's what it come to, Jim, and it<br>
begun with chuck-<span class=SpellE>farthen</span> on the blessed <span
class=GramE>grave-stones</span>! That's what it<br>
begun with, but it went <span class=SpellE>further'n</span> that; and <span
class=GramE>so</span> my mother told me, and<br>
<span class=SpellE>predicked</span> the whole, she did, the pious woman! But it
<span class=GramE>were</span> Providence<br>
that put me here. I've thought it all out in this here lonely island,<br>
and I'm back on piety. You don't catch me tasting rum so much, but just<br>
a thimbleful for luck, of course, the first chance I have. I'm bound<br>
I'll be good, and I see the way to. <span class=GramE>And,</span> Jim&quot;--looking
all round him and<br>
lowering his voice to a whisper--&quot;I'm rich.&quot;<br>
<br>
I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and<br>
I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the<br>
statement hotly: &quot;Rich! Rich! I <span class=GramE>says</span>. And I'll
tell you what: I'll make<br>
a man of you, Jim. Ah, Jim, you'll bless your stars, you will, you was<br>
the first that found me!&quot;<br>
<br>
And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face, and he<br>
tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly<br>
before my eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, Jim, you tell me true: that <span class=SpellE>ain't</span> Flint's
ship?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
At this I had a happy inspiration. I began to believe that I had found<br>
an ally, and I answered him at once.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's not Flint's ship, and Flint is dead; but I'll tell you true, as<br>
you ask me--there are some of Flint's hands aboard; worse luck for the<br>
rest of us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not a man--with one--leg?&quot; he gasped.<br>
<br>
&quot;Silver?&quot; I asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, Silver!&quot; says he. &quot;That were his name.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He's the cook, and the ringleader too.&quot;<br>
<br>
He was still holding me by the wrist, and at that he <span class=GramE>give</span>
it quite a<br>
wring.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you was sent by Long John,&quot; he said, &quot;I'm as good as pork,
and I<br>
know it. But where was you, do you suppose?&quot;<br>
<br>
I had made my mind up in a moment, and by way of answer told him<br>
the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found<br>
ourselves. He heard me with the keenest interest, and when I had <span
class=GramE>done</span> he<br>
patted me on the head.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're a good lad, Jim,&quot; he said; &quot;and you're all in a clove
hitch,<br>
<span class=SpellE>ain't</span> you? Well, you just put your trust in Ben
Gunn--Ben Gunn's the man<br>
to do it. Would you think it likely, now, that your squire would prove<br>
a liberal-minded one in case of help--him being in a clove hitch, as you<br>
remark?&quot;<br>
<br>
I told him the squire was the most liberal of men.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, but you see,&quot; returned Ben Gunn, &quot;I didn't mean giving me
a gate<br>
to keep, and a suit of livery clothes, and such; that's not my mark,<br>
Jim. What I mean is, would he be likely to come down to the toon of, say<br>
one thousand pounds out of money that's as good as a man's own already?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am sure he would,&quot; said I. &quot;As it was, all hands were to
share.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;AND a passage home?&quot; he added with a look of great shrewdness.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why,&quot; I cried, &quot;the squire's a gentleman. And besides, if we
got rid of<br>
the others, we should want you to help work the vessel home.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah,&quot; said he, &quot;so you would.&quot; And he seemed very much
relieved.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, I'll tell you what,&quot; he went on. &quot;So much I'll tell you,
and no<br>
more. I <span class=GramE>were</span> in Flint's ship when he buried the
treasure; he and<br>
six along--six strong seamen. They <span class=GramE>was</span> ashore nigh on
a week, and us<br>
standing off and on in the old WALRUS. One fine day up went the signal,<br>
and here <span class=GramE>come</span> Flint by himself in a little boat, and
his head done up in<br>
a blue scarf. The sun was getting up, and mortal white he looked about<br>
the cutwater. <span class=GramE>But,</span> there he was, you mind, and the six
all dead--<span class=SpellE>dead</span><br>
and buried. How he done it, not a man aboard us could make out. It was<br>
battle, murder, and sudden death, leastways--him against six. Billy<br>
Bones was the mate; Long John, he was quartermaster; and they asked him<br>
where the treasure was. 'Ah,' says he, 'you can go ashore, if you like,<br>
and stay,' he says; 'but as for the ship, she'll beat up for more, by<br>
thunder!' That's what he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I was in another ship three years back, and we sighted this<br>
island. 'Boys,' said I, 'here's Flint's treasure; let's land and find<br>
it.' The <span class=SpellE>cap'n</span> was displeased at that, but my
messmates were <span class=GramE>all of</span> a<br>
mind and landed. Twelve days they looked for it, and every day they had<br>
the worse word for me, until one fine morning all hands went aboard. 'As<br>
for you, Benjamin Gunn,' says they, 'here's a musket,' they <span class=GramE>says</span>,
'and<br>
a spade, and pick-axe. You can stay here and find Flint's money for<br>
yourself,' they <span class=GramE>says</span>.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, Jim, three years have I been here, and not a bite of Christian<br>
diet from that day to this. But now, you look here; look at me. Do I<br>
look like a man before the mast? No, says you. Nor I weren't, <span
class=GramE>neither,</span> I<br>
says.&quot;<br>
<br>
And with that he winked and pinched me hard.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just you mention them words to your squire, Jim,&quot; he went on.
&quot;Nor he<br>
weren't, neither--that's the words. Three years he were the man of this<br>
island, light and dark, fair and rain; and sometimes he would maybe<br>
think upon a prayer (says you), and sometimes he would maybe think of<br>
his old mother, so be as she's alive (you'll say); but the most part<br>
of Gunn's time (this is what you'll say)--the most part of his time was<br>
took up with another matter. And then you'll give him a nip, like I do.&quot;<br>
<br>
And he <span class=SpellE>pinched</span> me again in the most confidential
manner.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then,&quot; he continued, &quot;then you'll up, and you'll say this: Gunn
is a<br>
good man (you'll say), and he puts a precious sight more confidence--a<br>
precious sight, mind that--in a <span class=SpellE>gen'leman</span> born than
in these <span class=SpellE>gen'leman</span><br>
of fortune, having been one <span class=SpellE>hisself</span>.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;I don't understand one word that you've been
saying.<br>
But that's neither here nor there; for how am I to get on board?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah,&quot; said he, &quot;that's the hitch, for sure. Well, there's my
boat, that<br>
I made with my two hands. I keep her under the white rock. If the worst<br>
come to the worst, we might try that after dark. Hi!&quot; he broke out.<br>
&quot;What's that?&quot;<br>
<br>
For just then, although the sun had still an hour or two to run, all the<br>
echoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a cannon.<br>
<br>
&quot;They have begun to fight!&quot; I cried. &quot;Follow me.&quot;<br>
<br>
And I began to run towards the anchorage, my terrors all forgotten,<br>
while close at my side the marooned man in his goatskins trotted easily<br>
and lightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Left, left,&quot; says he; &quot;keep to your left hand, mate Jim! Under
the<br>
trees with you! Theer's where I killed my first goat. They don't come<br>
down here now; they're all mastheaded on them mountings for the fear<br>
of Benjamin Gunn. Ah! And there's the <span class=SpellE>cetemery</span>&quot;--cemetery,
he must have<br>
meant. &quot;You see the mounds? I come here and prayed, <span class=SpellE>nows</span>
and <span class=SpellE>thens</span>, when<br>
I thought maybe a Sunday would be about doo. It weren't quite a chapel,<br>
but it seemed more solemn like; and then, says you, Ben Gunn was<br>
short-handed--no <span class=SpellE>chapling</span>, nor so much as a Bible and
a flag, you says.&quot;<br>
<br>
So he kept talking as I ran, neither expecting nor receiving any answer.<br>
<br>
The cannon-shot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley<br>
of small arms.<br>
<br>
Another pause, and then, not a quarter of a mile in front of me, I<br>
beheld the Union Jack flutter in the air above a wood.<br>

        <p>1. Jim sees a figure running quickly behind a pine tree after hearing a spout of gravel falling through the trees. He can't identify whether it's a bear, a man, or a monkey due to its shaggy and dark appearance. The sight of this new apparition terrifies him, and he becomes unsure of what to do, feeling cut off from both the murderers and this unknown figure. His fear of the unknown creature makes him decide to head back in the direction of the boats.</p>
        <p>2. The mysterious figure is revealed to be Ben Gunn, a marooned sailor who has been living on the island for three years. He is a white man, but his skin is burnt by the sun, his lips are black, and his appearance is ragged. He is clad in tatters of old ship's canvas and sea-cloth, held together with various fastenings like brass buttons, bits of stick, and loops of tarry gaskin. He wears an old brass-buckled leather belt, which is the only solid piece in his outfit.</p>
        <p>3. Ben Gunn tells Jim that he was in Flint's ship when they buried the treasure on the island. He explains that Flint and six strong seamen went ashore to bury the treasure, but only Flint returned, with the six seamen dead and buried. He mentions that he had attempted to find the treasure with a group of men who had landed on the island but was marooned by them. He has been living on the island ever since, surviving on goats, berries, and oysters. Jim is initially skeptical of Ben Gunn's story but is willing to listen, especially after Gunn mentions the treasure.</p>
