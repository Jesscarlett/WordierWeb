IT was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea,<br>
and none of our first plans--not even Dr. Livesey's, of keeping me<br>
beside him--could be carried out as we intended. The doctor had to go<br>
to London for a physician to take charge of his practice; the squire was<br>
hard at work at Bristol; and I lived on at the hall under the charge of<br>
old Redruth, the gamekeeper, almost a prisoner, but full of sea-dreams<br>
and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures.<br>
I brooded by the hour together over the map, all the details of which<br>
I <span class=SpellE>well remembered</span>. Sitting by the fire in the
housekeeper's room, I<br>
approached that island in my fancy from every possible direction; I<br>
explored every acre of its surface; I climbed a thousand times to that<br>
tall hill they call the <span class=GramE>Spy-glass</span>, and from the top
enjoyed the most<br>
wonderful and changing prospects. Sometimes the isle was thick with<br>
savages, with whom we fought, sometimes full of dangerous animals that<br>
hunted us, but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and<br>
tragic as our actual adventures.<br>
<br>
So the weeks passed on, till one fine day there came a letter addressed<br>
to Dr. Livesey, with this addition, &quot;To be opened, in the case of his<br>
absence, by Tom Redruth or young Hawkins.&quot; Obeying this order, we<br>
found, or rather I found--for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading<br>
anything but print--the following important news:<br>
<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Old Anchor Inn, Bristol, March 1,
17--<br>
<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Dear Livesey--As I do not know
whether you<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>are at the hall or still in London,
I send this in<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>double to both places.<br>
<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>The ship is bought and fitted.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She lies at<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>anchor, ready for sea.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You never imagined a<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>sweeter schooner--a child might sail
her--two<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>hundred tons; name, HISPANIOLA.<br>
<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>I got her through my old friend,
Blandly, who<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>has proved himself throughout the
most surprising<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>trump.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The admirable fellow literally slaved in<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>my interest, and so, I may say, did
everyone in<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Bristol, as soon as they got wind of
the <span class=GramE>port</span> we<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>sailed for--treasure, I mean.<br>
<br>
&quot;Redruth,&quot; said I, interrupting the letter, &quot;Dr. Livesey will
not like<br>
that. The squire has been talking, after all.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, who's a better right?&quot; growled the gamekeeper. &quot;A pretty
rum go<br>
if squire <span class=SpellE>ain't</span> to talk for Dr. Livesey, I should
think.&quot;<br>
<br>
At that I gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight on:<br>
<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Blandly himself found the
HISPANIOLA, and<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>by the most admirable management got
her for the<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>merest trifle.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a class of men in Bristol<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>monstrously prejudiced against
Blandly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They go<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>the length of declaring that this
honest creature<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>would do anything for money, that
the HISPANIOLA<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>belonged to him, and that he sold it
me absurdly<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>high--the most transparent
calumnies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>None of them<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>dare, however, to deny the merits of
the ship.<br>
<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>So far there was not a hitch.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>workpeople, to be sure--riggers and
what not--were<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>most annoyingly slow; but time cured
that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>the crew that troubled me.<br>
<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>I wished a round score of men--in
case of<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>natives, buccaneers, or the odious
French--and I<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>had the worry of the deuce itself to
find so much<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>as half a dozen, till the most
remarkable stroke<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>of fortune brought me the very man
that I<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>required.<br>
<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>I was standing on the dock, when, by
the<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>merest accident, I fell in talk with
him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I found<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>he was an old sailor, kept a <span
class=GramE>public-house</span>, knew<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>all the seafaring men in Bristol,
had lost his<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>health ashore, and wanted a good berth
as cook to<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>get to <span class=SpellE>sea</span>
again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He had hobbled down there that<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>morning, he said, to get a smell of
the salt.<br>
<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>I was monstrously touched--so would
you have<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>been--and, out of pure pity, I
engaged him on the<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>spot to be ship's cook.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Long John Silver, he is<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>called, and has lost a leg; but that
I regarded as<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>a recommendation, since he lost it
in his<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>country's service, under the
immortal Hawke.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>has no pension, Livesey.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Imagine the abominable<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>age we live in!<br>
<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Well, sir, I thought I had only
found a cook,<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>but it was a crew I had
discovered.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Between<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Silver and myself we got together in
a few days a<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>company of the toughest old salts
imaginable--not<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>pretty to look at, but fellows, by
their faces, of<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>the most indomitable spirit.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I declare we could<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>fight a frigate.<br>
<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Long John even got rid of two out of
the six<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>or seven I had already engaged.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He showed me in a<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>moment that they were just the sort
of <span class=GramE>fresh-water</span><br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>swabs we had to fear in an adventure of<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>importance.<br>
<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>I am in the most magnificent health
and<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>spirits, eating like a bull,
sleeping like a tree,<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>yet I shall not enjoy a moment till
I hear my old<br>

<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>that has turned my head.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So now, Livesey, come<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>post; do not lose an hour, if you

<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Let young Hawkins go at once to see

<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>an admirable fellow for sailing

<br>
You can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me. I was half<br>
beside myself with glee; and if ever I despised a man, it was old<br>
Tom Redruth, who could do nothing but grumble and lament. Any of the<br>
under-gamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him; but such<br>
was not the squire's pleasure, and the squire's pleasure was like law<br>
among them all. Nobody but old Redruth would have dared so much as even<br>
to grumble.<br>
<br>
The next morning he and I set out on foot for the Admiral Benbow, and<br>
there I found my mother in good health and spirits. The captain, who had<br>
so long been a cause of so much discomfort, was gone where the wicked<br>
cease from troubling. The squire had had everything repaired, and the<br>
public rooms and the sign repainted, and had added some furniture--above<br>
all a beautiful armchair for mother in the bar. He had found her a boy<br>
as an apprentice also so that she should not want help while I was gone.<br>
<br>
It was on seeing that boy that I understood, for the first time, my<br>
situation. I had thought up to that moment of the adventures before me,<br>
not at <span class=GramE>all of</span> the home that I was leaving; and now, at
sight of this<br>
clumsy stranger, who was to stay here in my place beside my mother, I<br>
had my first attack of tears. I am afraid I led that boy a dog's life,<br>
for as he was new to the work, I had a hundred opportunities of setting<br>
him right and putting him down, and I was not slow to profit by them.<br>
<br>
The night passed, and the next day, after dinner, Redruth and I were<br>
afoot again and on the road. I said good-bye to Mother and the<br>
cove where I had lived <span class=GramE>since</span> I was born, and the dear
old Admiral<br>
Benbow--since he was repainted, no longer quite so dear. One of my last<br>
thoughts was of the captain, who had so often <span class=GramE>strode</span>
along the beach<br>
with his cocked hat, his sabre-cut cheek, and his old brass telescope.<br>
Next moment we had turned the corner and my home was out of sight.<br>
<br>
The mail picked us up about dusk at the Royal George on the heath. I was<br>
wedged in between Redruth and a stout old gentleman, and in spite of the<br>
swift motion and the cold night air, I must have dozed a great deal from<br>
the very first, and then slept like a log up hill and down dale through<br>
stage after stage, for when I was awakened at last it was by a punch<br>
in the ribs, and I opened my eyes to find that we were standing still<br>
before a large building in a city street and that the day had already<br>
broken a long time.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where are we?&quot; I asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bristol,&quot; said Tom. &quot;Get down.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mr. Trelawney had taken up his residence at an inn far down the docks to<br>
superintend the work upon the schooner. Thither we had now to walk, and<br>
our way, to my great delight, lay along the quays and beside the great<br>
multitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and nations. In one, sailors<br>
were singing at their work, in another there were men aloft, high over<br>
my head, hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spider's.<br>
Though I had lived by the shore all my life, I seemed never to have been<br>
near the sea till then. The smell of tar and salt was something new.<br>
I saw the most wonderful figureheads, that had all been far over the<br>
ocean. I saw, besides, many old sailors, with rings in their ears, and<br>
whiskers curled in ringlets, and tarry pigtails, and their swaggering,<br>
clumsy sea-walk; and if I had seen as many kings or archbishops I could<br>
not have been more delighted.<br>
<br>
And I was going to <span class=SpellE>sea</span> myself, to sea in a schooner,
with a piping<br>
boatswain and pig-tailed singing seamen, to sea, bound for an unknown<br>
island, and to seek for buried treasure!<br>
<br>
While I was still in this delightful dream, we came suddenly in front<br>
of a large inn and met Squire Trelawney, all dressed out like a<br>
sea-officer, in stout blue cloth, coming out of the door with a smile on<br>
his face and a capital imitation of a sailor's walk.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here you are,&quot; he cried, &quot;and the doctor came last night from
London.<br>
Bravo! The ship's company complete!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, sir,&quot; cried I, &quot;when do we sail?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sail!&quot; says he. &quot;We sail tomorrow!&quot;<br>

        <p>1. The original plans for the voyage couldn't be carried out as intended because various circumstances interfered. Dr. Livesey had to go to London to find a physician to take over his practice. The squire was occupied with work in Bristol. As a result, young Jim Hawkins was left under the care of old Redruth, the gamekeeper, at the hall, which prevented him from accompanying the others as they had initially planned.</p>
        <p>2. The letter from Mr. Trelawney contained several important pieces of information:</p>
        <ul type=disc>
             <li>He had bought and fitted a ship called the
                 HISPANIOLA, which was ready for sea and described as a sweet schooner of
                 two hundred tons.<o:p></o:p></span></li>
             <li>The ship had been acquired through the
                 assistance of an old friend named Blandly.<o:p></o:p></span></li>
             <li>Mr. Trelawney had assembled a crew of tough
                 and experienced sailors.<o:p></o:p></span></li>
             <li>He had hired Long John Silver as the ship's
                 cook, who was recommended despite having lost a leg in the service of his
                 country.<o:p></o:p></span></li>
             <li>The crew was now complete, and Mr. Trelawney
                 expressed his eagerness to set sail and his obsession with the glory of
                 the sea.<o:p></o:p></span></li>
             <li>He urged Dr. Livesey to join him in Bristol as
                 soon as possible and advised young Hawkins to visit his mother before the
                 voyage.<o:p></o:p></span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>3. Jim Hawkins was extremely excited and filled with glee upon receiving the news of the upcoming voyage. He had been eagerly anticipating the adventure and had been engrossed in studying the map of the island where they believed treasure was hidden. The prospect of setting sail, exploring strange islands, and embarking on this grand adventure thrilled him. However, he also experienced a moment of sadness and realization that he was leaving behind his home, especially when he met the boy who would be staying with his mother in his absence. Nonetheless, his overall sentiment was one of excitement and anticipation.</p>

<div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:30px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px;">
    <p class="w3-large"><strong>8. At the Sign of the Spy-glass</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
        <br>
WHEN I had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to John<br>
Silver, at the sign of the Spy-glass, and told me I should easily<br>
find the place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright<br>
lookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign. I<br>
set off, overjoyed at this opportunity to see some more of the ships and<br>
seamen, and picked my way among a great crowd of people and carts and<br>
bales, for the dock was now at its busiest, until I found the tavern in<br>
question.<br>
<br>
It was a bright enough little place of entertainment. The sign was<br>
newly painted; the windows had neat red curtains; the floor was cleanly<br>
sanded. There was a street on each side and an open door on both, which<br>
made the large, low room pretty clear to see in, in spite of clouds of<br>
tobacco smoke.<br>
<br>
The customers were mostly seafaring men, and they talked so loudly that<br>
I hung at the door, almost afraid to enter.<br>
<br>
As I was waiting, a man came out of a side room, and at a glance I was<br>
sure he must be Long John. His left leg was cut off close by the hip,<br>
and under the left shoulder he carried a crutch, which he managed with<br>
wonderful dexterity, hopping about upon it like a bird. He was very tall<br>
and strong, with a face as big as a ham--plain and pale, but intelligent<br>
and smiling. Indeed, he seemed in the most cheerful spirits, whistling<br>
as he moved about among the tables, with a merry word or a slap on the<br>
shoulder for the more favoured of his guests.<br>
<br>
Now, to tell you the truth, from the very first mention of Long John in<br>
Squire Trelawney's letter I had taken a fear in my mind that he might<br>
prove to be the very one-legged sailor whom I had watched for so long at<br>
the old Benbow. But one look at the man before me was enough. I had seen<br>
the captain, and Black Dog, and the blind man, Pew, and I thought I knew<br>
what a buccaneer was like--a very different creature, according to me,<br>
from this clean and pleasant-tempered landlord.<br>
<br>
I plucked up courage at once, crossed the threshold, and walked right up<br>
to the man where he stood, propped on his crutch, talking to a customer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mr. Silver, sir?&quot; I asked, holding out the note.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, my lad,&quot; said he; &quot;such is my name, to be sure. And who
may you<br>
be?&quot; And then as he saw the squire's letter, he seemed to me to give<br>
something almost like a start.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh!&quot; said he, quite loud, and offering his hand. &quot;I see. You
are our<br>
new cabin-boy; pleased I am to see you.&quot;<br>
<br>
And he took my hand in his large firm grasp.<br>
<br>
Just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made<br>
for the door. It was close by him, and he was out in the street in a<br>
moment. But his hurry had attracted my notice, and I recognized him at<br>
glance. It was the tallow-faced man, wanting two fingers, who had come<br>
first to the Admiral Benbow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh,&quot; I cried, &quot;stop him! It's Black Dog!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't care two coppers who he is,&quot; cried Silver. &quot;But he
hasn't paid<br>
his score. Harry, run and catch him.&quot;<br>
<br>
One of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started in<br>
pursuit.<br>
<br>
&quot;If he were Admiral Hawke he shall pay his score,&quot; cried Silver; and<br>
then, relinquishing my hand, &quot;Who did you say he was?&quot; he asked.
&quot;Black<br>
what?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dog, sir,&quot; said I. &quot;Has Mr. Trelawney not told you of the
buccaneers?<br>
He was one of them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So?&quot; cried Silver. &quot;In my house! Ben, run and help Harry. One
of those<br>
swabs, was he? Was that you drinking with him, Morgan? Step up here.&quot;<br>
<br>
The man whom he called Morgan--an old, grey-haired, mahogany-faced<br>
sailor--came forward pretty sheepishly, rolling his quid.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, Morgan,&quot; said Long John very sternly, &quot;you never clapped
your eyes<br>
on that Black--<span class=SpellE>Black</span> Dog before, did you, now?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not I, sir,&quot; said Morgan with a salute.<br>
<br>
&quot;You didn't know his name, did you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, sir.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;By the powers, Tom Morgan, it's as good for you!&quot; exclaimed the<br>
landlord. &quot;If you had been mixed up with the like of that, you would<br>
never have put another foot in my house, you may lay to that. And what<br>
was he saying to you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't rightly know, sir,&quot; answered Morgan.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you call that a head on your shoulders, or a blessed <span
class=GramE>dead-eye</span>?&quot;<br>
cried Long John. &quot;Don't rightly know, don't you! Perhaps you don't<br>
happen to rightly know who you <span class=GramE>was</span> speaking to,
perhaps? Come, now, what<br>
was he jawing--<span class=SpellE>v'yages</span>, <span class=SpellE>cap'ns</span>,
ships? Pipe up! What was it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We was a-<span class=SpellE>talkin</span>' of <span class=GramE>keel-hauling</span>,&quot;
answered Morgan.<br>
<br>
&quot;Keel-hauling, was you? And a mighty suitable thing, too, and you may<br>
lay to that. Get back to your place for a lubber, Tom.&quot;<br>
<br>
And then, as Morgan rolled back to his seat, Silver added to me in a<br>
confidential whisper that was very flattering, as I thought, &quot;He's<br>
quite an honest man, Tom Morgan, <span class=SpellE>on'y</span> stupid. And
now,&quot; he ran on again,<br>
aloud, &quot;let's see--Black Dog? No, I don't know the name, not I. Yet I<br>
kind of think I've--yes, I've seen the swab. He used to come here with a<br>
blind beggar, he used.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That he did, you may be sure,&quot; said I. &quot;I knew that blind man
too. His<br>
name was Pew.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It was!&quot; cried Silver, now quite excited. &quot;Pew! That were his
name for<br>
certain. Ah, he looked a shark, he did! If we run down this Black Dog,<br>
now, there'll be news for <span class=SpellE>Cap'n</span> Trelawney! Ben's a
good runner; few<br>
seamen run better than Ben. He should run him down, hand over hand, by<br>
the powers! He talked o' <span class=GramE>keel-hauling</span>, did he? I'LL
keel-haul him!&quot;<br>
<br>
All the time he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up and<br>
down the tavern on his crutch, slapping tables with his hand, and giving<br>
such a show of excitement as would have convinced an Old Bailey judge<br>
or a Bow Street runner. My suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on<br>
finding Black Dog at the <span class=GramE>Spy-glass</span>, and I watched the
cook narrowly. But<br>
he was too deep, and too ready, and too clever for me, and by the time<br>
the two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost<br>
the track in a crowd, and been scolded like thieves, I would have gone<br>
bail for the innocence of Long John Silver.<br>
<br>
&quot;See here, now, Hawkins,&quot; said he, &quot;here's a blessed hard thing
on a<br>
man like me, now, <span class=SpellE>ain't</span> it? There's <span
class=SpellE>Cap'n</span> Trelawney--what's he to think?<br>
Here I have this confounded son of a Dutchman sitting in my own house<br>
drinking of my own rum! Here you <span class=GramE>comes</span> and tells me of
it plain; and<br>
here I let him give us all the slip before my blessed deadlights! Now,<br>
Hawkins, you do me justice with the <span class=SpellE>cap'n</span>. You're a
lad, you are, but<br>
you're as smart as paint. I see that when you first come in. Now, here<br>
it is: What could I do, with this old timber I hobble on? When I was an<br>
A B master mariner I'd have come up alongside of him, hand over hand,<br>
and broached him to in a brace of old shakes, I would; but now--&quot;<br>
<br>
And then, all of a sudden, he stopped, and his jaw dropped as though he<br>
had remembered something.<br>
<br>
&quot;The score!&quot; he burst out. &quot;Three goes o' rum! Why, shiver my
timbers,<br>
if I hadn't forgotten my score!&quot;<br>
<br>
And falling on a bench, he laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks.<br>
I could not help joining, and we laughed together, peal after peal,<br>
until the tavern rang again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, what a precious old sea-calf I am!&quot; he said at last, wiping his<br>
cheeks. &quot;You and <span class=GramE>me</span> should get on well, Hawkins,
for I'll take my <span class=SpellE>davy</span><br>
I should be rated ship's boy. But come now, stand by to go about. This<br>
won't do. <span class=SpellE>Dooty</span> is <span class=SpellE>dooty</span>,
messmates. I'll put on my old cockerel hat,<br>
and step along of you to <span class=SpellE>Cap'n</span> Trelawney, and report
this here affair.<br>
For mind you, it's serious, young Hawkins; and neither you nor <span
class=SpellE>me's</span> come<br>
out of it with what I should make so bold as to call credit. Nor you<br>
neither, says you; not smart--none of the pair of us smart. But dash my<br>
buttons! That was a good un about my score.&quot;<br>
<br>
And he began to laugh again, and that so heartily, that though I did not<br>
see the joke as he did, I was again obliged to join him in his mirth.<br>
<br>
On our little walk along the quays, he made himself the most interesting<br>
companion, telling me about the different ships that we passed by,<br>
their rig, tonnage, and nationality, explaining the work that was going<br>
forward--how one was discharging, another taking in cargo, and a third<br>
making ready for sea--and every now and then telling me some little<br>
anecdote of ships or seamen or repeating a nautical phrase till I had<br>
learned it perfectly. I began to see that here was one of the best of<br>
possible shipmates.<br>
<br>
When we got to the inn, the squire and Dr. Livesey were seated together,<br>
finishing a quart of ale with a toast in it, before they should go<br>
aboard the schooner on a visit of inspection.<br>
<br>
Long John told the story from first to last, with a great deal of spirit<br>
and the most perfect truth. &quot;That was how it were, now, weren't it,<br>
Hawkins?&quot; he would say, now and again, and I could always bear him<br>
entirely out.<br>
<br>
The two gentlemen regretted that Black Dog had got away, but we all<br>
agreed there was nothing to be done, and after he had been complimented,<br>
Long John took up his crutch and departed.<br>
<br>
&quot;All hands aboard by four this afternoon,&quot; shouted the squire after
him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, aye, sir,&quot; cried the cook, in the passage.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, squire,&quot; said Dr. Livesey, &quot;I don't put much faith in
your<br>
discoveries, as a general thing; but I will say this, John Silver suits<br>
me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The man's a perfect trump,&quot; declared the squire.<br>
<br>
&quot;And now,&quot; added the doctor, &quot;Jim may come on board with us, may
he<br>
not?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;To be sure he may,&quot; says squire. &quot;Take your hat, Hawkins, and
we'll see<br>
the ship.&quot;<br>

        <p>1. The squire gave Jim Hawkins a note addressed to John Silver, instructing him to go to the "sign of the Spy-glass" and find Mr. Silver there. He guided Jim on how to locate the place, describing it as a little tavern with a large brass telescope for a sign.</p>
        <p>2. Long John Silver is described as a tall and strong man with a face as big as a ham. He has a plain and pale face but appears intelligent and smiling. He has a cheerful and pleasant demeanor, seeming to be in high spirits despite his missing leg. He is able to move about nimbly on his crutch, and he interacts with his customers in a friendly manner.</p>
        <p>3. When Jim mentioned Black Dog and the buccaneers, Long John Silver initially did not recognize the name. However, when Jim explained that Black Dog was one of the buccaneers and that he had been seen drinking with him, Long John Silver became intrigued and asked more questions. He even sent men to pursue Black Dog when he left without paying his bill. This showed that he was concerned about the presence of someone associated with the buccaneers in his establishment and was willing to take action to address it.</p>

<br>
THE HISPANIOLA lay some way out, and we went under the figureheads and<br>
round the sterns of many other ships, and their cables sometimes grated<br>
underneath our keel, and sometimes swung above us. At last, however,<br>
we got alongside, and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the<br>
mate, Mr. Arrow, <span class=GramE>a brown old</span> sailor with earrings in
his ears and a<br>
squint. He and the squire were very thick and friendly, but I soon<br>
observed that things were not the same between Mr. Trelawney and the<br>
captain.<br>
<br>
This last was a sharp-looking man who seemed angry with everything on<br>
board and was soon to tell us why, for we had hardly got down into the<br>
cabin when a sailor followed us.<br>
<br>
&quot;Captain Smollett, sir, axing to speak with you,&quot; said he.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am always at the captain's orders. Show him in,&quot; said the squire.<br>
<br>
The captain, who was close behind his messenger, entered at once and<br>
shut the door behind him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, Captain Smollett, what have you to say? All well, I hope; all<br>
shipshape and seaworthy?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, sir,&quot; said the captain, &quot;better speak plain, I believe,
even at<br>
the risk of offence. I don't like this cruise; I don't like the men; and<br>
I don't like my officer. That's short and sweet.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Perhaps, sir, you don't like the ship?&quot; inquired the squire, very<br>
angry, as I could see.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't speak as to that, sir, not having seen her tried,&quot; said the<br>
captain. &quot;She seems a clever craft; more I can't say.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Possibly, sir, you may not like your employer, either?&quot; says the<br>
squire.<br>
<br>
But here Dr. Livesey cut in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stay a bit,&quot; said he, &quot;stay a bit. No use of such questions as
that but<br>
to produce ill feeling. The captain has said too <span class=GramE>much</span>
or he has said too<br>
little, and I'm bound to say that I require an explanation of his words.<br>
You don't, you say, like this cruise. Now, why?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to sail this ship<br>
for that gentleman where he should bid me,&quot; said the captain. &quot;So far<br>
so good. But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I<br>
do. I don't call that fair, now, do you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; said Dr. Livesey, &quot;I don't.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Next,&quot; said the captain, &quot;I learn we are going after
treasure--hear<br>
it from my own hands, mind you. Now, treasure is ticklish work; I don't<br>
like treasure voyages on any account, and I don't like them, above all,<br>
when they are secret and when (begging your pardon, Mr. Trelawney) the<br>
secret has been told to the parrot.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Silver's parrot?&quot; asked the squire.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's a way of speaking,&quot; said the captain. &quot;Blabbed, I mean.
It's my<br>
belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about, but I'll tell<br>
you my way of it--life or death, and a close run.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That is all clear, and, I dare say, true enough,&quot; replied Dr.
Livesey.<br>
&quot;We take the risk, but we are not so ignorant as you believe us. Next,<br>
you say you don't like the crew. Are they not good seamen?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't like them, sir,&quot; returned Captain Smollett. &quot;And I
think I<br>
should have had the choosing of my own hands, if you go to that.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Perhaps you should,&quot; replied the doctor. &quot;My friend should,
perhaps,<br>
have taken you along with him; but the slight, if there be one, was<br>
unintentional. And you don't like Mr. Arrow?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't, sir. I believe he's a good seaman, but he's too free with<br>
the crew to be a good officer. A mate should keep himself to<br>
himself--shouldn't drink with the men before the mast!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you mean he drinks?&quot; cried the squire.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, sir,&quot; replied the captain, &quot;only that he's too
familiar.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, now, and the short and long of it, captain?&quot; asked the doctor.<br>
&quot;Tell us what you want.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, gentlemen, are you determined to go on this cruise?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Like iron,&quot; answered the squire.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very good,&quot; said the captain. &quot;Then, as you've heard me very
patiently,<br>
saying things that I could not prove, hear me a few words more. They are<br>
putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold. Now, you have a good<br>
place under the cabin; why not put them <span class=GramE>there?--</span>first
point. Then, you<br>
are bringing four of your own people with you, and they tell me some of<br>
them are to be berthed forward. Why not give them the berths here beside<br>
the <span class=GramE>cabin?--</span>second point.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Any more?&quot; asked Mr. Trelawney.<br>
<br>
&quot;One more,&quot; said the captain. &quot;There's been too much blabbing
already.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Far too much,&quot; agreed the doctor.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll tell you what I've heard myself,&quot; continued Captain Smollett:<br>
&quot;that you have a map of an island, that there's crosses on the map to<br>
show where treasure is, and that the island lies--&quot; And then he named<br>
the latitude and longitude exactly.<br>
<br>
&quot;I never told that,&quot; cried the squire, &quot;to a soul!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The hands know it, sir,&quot; returned the captain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Livesey, that must have been you or Hawkins,&quot; cried the squire.<br>
<br>
&quot;It doesn't much matter who it was,&quot; replied the doctor. And I could<br>
see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney's<br>
protestations. Neither did I, to be sure, he was so loose a talker; yet<br>
in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the<br>
situation of the island.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, gentlemen,&quot; continued the captain, &quot;I don't know who has
this<br>
map; but I make it a point, it shall be kept secret even from me and Mr.<br>
Arrow. <span class=GramE>Otherwise</span> I would ask you to let me
resign.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I see,&quot; said the doctor. &quot;You wish us to keep this matter dark
and to<br>
make a garrison of the stern part of the ship, manned with my friend's<br>
own people, and provided with all the arms and powder on board. In other<br>
words, you fear a mutiny.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir,&quot; said Captain Smollett, &quot;with no intention to take
offence, I<br>
deny your right to put words into my mouth. No captain, sir, would be<br>
justified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that. As<br>
for Mr. Arrow, I believe him thoroughly honest; some of the men are the<br>
same; all may be for what I know. But I am responsible for the ship's<br>
safety and the life of every man Jack aboard of her. I see things going,<br>
as I think, not quite right. And I ask you to take certain precautions<br>
or let me resign my berth. And that's all.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Captain Smollett,&quot; began the doctor with a smile, &quot;did ever you
hear<br>
the fable of the mountain and the mouse? You'll excuse me, I dare say,<br>
but you remind me of that fable. When you came in here, I'll stake my<br>
wig, you meant more than this.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Doctor,&quot; said the captain, &quot;you are smart. When I came in <span
class=GramE>here</span> I meant<br>
to get discharged. I had no thought that Mr. Trelawney would hear a<br>
word.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No more I would,&quot; cried the squire. &quot;Had Livesey not been here
I should<br>
have seen you to the deuce. As it is, I have heard you. I will do as you<br>
desire, but I think the worse of you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's as you please, sir,&quot; said the captain. &quot;You'll find I do
my<br>
duty.&quot;<br>
<br>
And with that he took his leave.<br>
<br>
&quot;Trelawney,&quot; said the doctor, &quot;contrary to all my notions, I
believed<br>
you have managed to get two honest men on board with you--that man and<br>
John Silver.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Silver, if you like,&quot; cried the squire; &quot;but as for that
intolerable<br>
humbug, I declare I think his conduct unmanly, <span class=SpellE>unsailorly</span>,
and downright<br>
un-English.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; says the doctor, &quot;we shall see.&quot;<br>
<br>
When we came on deck, the men had begun already to take out the arms and<br>
powder, <span class=SpellE>yo-ho-ing</span> at their work, while the captain
and Mr. Arrow stood<br>
by superintending.<br>
<br>
The new arrangement was quite to my liking. The whole schooner had been<br>
overhauled; six berths had been made astern out of what had been the<br>
after-part of the main hold; and this set of cabins was only joined to<br>
the galley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side. It had<br>
been originally meant that the captain, Mr. Arrow, Hunter, Joyce, the<br>
doctor, and the squire were to occupy these six berths. Now Redruth and<br>
I <span class=GramE>were</span> to get two of them and Mr. Arrow and the
captain were to sleep<br>
on deck in the companion, which had been enlarged on each side till you<br>
might almost have called it a round-house. Very low it was still, of<br>
course; but there was room to swing two hammocks, and even the mate<br>
seemed pleased with the arrangement. Even he, perhaps, had been doubtful<br>
as to the crew, but that is only guess, for as you shall hear, we had<br>
not long the benefit of his opinion.<br>
<br>
We were all hard at work, changing the powder and the berths, when<br>
the last man or two, and Long John along with them, came off in a<br>
shore-boat.<br>
<br>
The cook came up the side like a monkey for cleverness, and as soon as<br>
he saw what was doing, &quot;So <span class=SpellE>ho</span>, mates!&quot; says
he. &quot;What's this?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We're a-changing of the powder, Jack,&quot; answers one.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, by the powers,&quot; cried Long John, &quot;if we do, we'll miss the
morning<br>
tide!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My orders!&quot; said the captain shortly. &quot;You may go below, my
man. Hands<br>
will want supper.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, aye, sir,&quot; answered the cook, and touching his forelock, he<br>
disappeared at once in the direction of his galley.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's a good man, captain,&quot; said the doctor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very likely, sir,&quot; replied Captain Smollett. &quot;Easy with that,<br>
men--easy,&quot; he ran on, to the fellows who were shifting the powder; and<br>
then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships,<br>
a long brass nine, &quot;Here you, ship's boy,&quot; he cried, &quot;out o'
that! Off<br>
with you to the cook and get some work.&quot;<br>
<br>
And then as I was hurrying off I heard him say, quite loudly, to the<br>
doctor, &quot;I'll have no favourites on my ship.&quot;<br>
<br>
I assure you I was quite of the squire's way of thinking, and hated the<br>
captain deeply.<br>

        <p>1. Captain Smollett has several concerns and complaints about the voyage. First, he expresses his dissatisfaction with the crew, the ship, and Mr. Arrow, the ship's mate. He is also unhappy that the crew seems to know more about the voyage than he does, indicating a lack of transparency. Furthermore, he reveals his dislike for treasure voyages, especially when they are secretive. He suspects that the crew is too familiar with Mr. Arrow, believing that officers should not drink with the crew. Finally, he expresses concern that the location of the treasure and the ship's mission have been revealed to others, possibly due to loose talk.</p>
        <p>2. Captain Smollett proposes several precautions to address his concerns. He suggests storing the powder and arms in a different location, specifically in the fore hold instead of the cabin. He also recommends that the captain's friends be accommodated near the cabin instead of berthing forward with the crew. Most importantly, he insists on the need for secrecy regarding the map of the island with the treasure and its coordinates. He wants the map to be kept secret even from himself and Mr. Arrow. Essentially, he is concerned about the possibility of a mutiny and wants to take precautions to prevent it.</p>
        <p>3. The squire, Mr. Trelawney, is initially reluctant to accept Captain Smollett's concerns and accuses him of trying to resign his position. However, he ultimately agrees to Captain Smollett's proposals, and the doctor, Dr. Livesey, also supports the precautions. Dr. Livesey even compares Captain Smollett's concerns to the fable of the mountain and the mouse, suggesting that the captain's fears may be exaggerated. Nonetheless, they agree to implement the precautions and keep the treasure map and its coordinates secret.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>10. The Voyage</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
ALL that night we were in a great bustle getting things stowed in their<br>
place, and <span class=SpellE>boatfuls</span> of the squire's friends, Mr.
Blandly and the like,<br>
coming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return. We never had<br>
a night at the Admiral Benbow when I had half the work; and I was<br>
dog-tired when, a little before dawn, the boatswain sounded his pipe<br>
and the crew began to man the capstan-bars. I might have been twice<br>
as weary, yet I would not have left the deck, all was so new and<br>
interesting to me--the brief commands, the shrill note of the whistle,<br>
the men bustling to their places in the glimmer of the ship's lanterns.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, Barbecue, tip us a stave,&quot; cried one voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;The old one,&quot; cried another.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, aye, mates,&quot; said Long John, who was standing by, with his
crutch<br>
under his arm, and at once broke out in the air and words I knew so<br>
well:<br>
<br>
&quot;Fifteen men on the dead man's chest--&quot;<br>
<br>
And then the whole crew bore chorus:--<br>
<br>
&quot;Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!&quot;<br>
<br>
And at the third &quot;Ho!&quot; drove the bars before them with a will.<br>
<br>
Even at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old Admiral<br>
Benbow in a second, and I seemed to hear the voice of the captain piping<br>
in the chorus. But soon the anchor was short up; soon it was hanging<br>
dripping at the bows; soon the sails began to draw, and the land and<br>
shipping to flit by on either side; and before I could lie down to<br>
snatch an hour of slumber the HISPANIOLA had begun her voyage to the<br>
Isle of Treasure.<br>
<br>
I am not going to relate that voyage in detail. It was fairly<br>
prosperous. The ship proved to be a good ship, the crew were capable<br>
seamen, and the captain thoroughly understood his business. But before<br>
we came the length of Treasure Island, two or three things had happened<br>
which require to be known.<br>
<br>
Mr. Arrow, <span class=GramE>first of all</span>, turned out even worse than
the captain had<br>
feared. He had no command among the men, and people did what they<br>
pleased with him. But that was by no means the worst of it, for after a<br>
day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye, red cheeks,<br>
stuttering tongue, and other marks of drunkenness. Time after time<br>
he was ordered below in disgrace. Sometimes he fell and cut himself;<br>
sometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk at one side of the<br>
companion; sometimes for a day or two he would be almost sober and<br>
attend to his work at least passably.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, we could never make out where he got the drink. That<br>
was the ship's mystery. Watch him as we pleased, we could do nothing to<br>
solve it; and when we asked him to his face, he would only laugh if<br>
he were drunk, and if he were sober deny solemnly that he ever tasted<br>
anything but water.<br>
<br>
He was not only useless as an officer and a bad influence amongst<br>
the men, but it was plain that at this rate he must soon kill himself<br>
outright, so nobody was much surprised, nor very sorry, when one dark<br>
night, with a head sea, he disappeared entirely and was seen no more.<br>
<br>
&quot;Overboard!&quot; said the captain. &quot;Well, gentlemen, that saves the
trouble<br>
of putting him in irons.&quot;<br>
<br>
But there we were, without a mate; and it was necessary, of course, to<br>
advance one of the men. The boatswain, Job Anderson, was the likeliest<br>
man aboard, and though he kept his old title, he served in a way as<br>
mate. Mr. Trelawney had followed the sea, and his knowledge made him<br>
very useful, for he often took a watch himself in easy weather. And the<br>
coxswain, Israel Hands, was a careful, wily, old, experienced seaman who<br>
could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything.<br>
<br>
He was a great confidant of Long John Silver, and so the mention of<br>
his name leads me on to speak of our ship's cook, Barbecue, as the men<br>
called him.<br>
<br>
Aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck, to have<br>
both hands as free as possible. It was something to see him wedge the<br>
foot of the crutch against a bulkhead, and propped against it, yielding<br>
to every movement of the ship, get on with his cooking like someone safe<br>
ashore. Still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather<br>
cross the deck. He had a line or two rigged up to help him across the<br>
widest spaces--Long John's earrings, they were called; and he would hand<br>
himself from one place to another, now using the crutch, now trailing it<br>
alongside by the lanyard, as quickly as another man could walk. Yet some<br>
of the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see<br>
him so reduced.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's no common man, Barbecue,&quot; said the coxswain to me. &quot;He had
good<br>
schooling in his young days and can speak like a book when so minded;<br>
and brave--a lion's nothing alongside of Long John! I <span class=SpellE>seen</span>
him grapple<br>
four and knock their heads together--him unarmed.&quot;<br>
<br>
All the crew respected and even obeyed him. He had a way of talking<br>
to each and doing everybody some <span class=GramE>particular service</span>.
To me he was<br>
unweariedly kind, and always glad to see me in the galley, which he kept<br>
as clean as a new pin, the dishes hanging up burnished and his parrot in<br>
a cage in one corner.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come away, Hawkins,&quot; he would say; &quot;come and have a yarn with
John.<br>
Nobody more welcome than yourself, my son. Sit you down and hear the<br>
news. Here's <span class=SpellE>Cap'n</span> Flint--I calls my parrot <span
class=SpellE>Cap'n</span> Flint, after the<br>
famous buccaneer--here's <span class=SpellE>Cap'n</span> Flint predicting
success to our <span class=SpellE>v'yage</span>.<br>
Wasn't you, <span class=SpellE>cap'n</span>?&quot;<br>
<br>
And the parrot would say, with great rapidity, &quot;Pieces of eight! Pieces<br>
of eight! Pieces of eight!&quot; till you wondered that it was not out of<br>
breath, or till John threw his handkerchief over the cage.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, that bird,&quot; he would say, &quot;is, maybe, two hundred years<br>
old, Hawkins--they live forever mostly; and if anybody's seen more<br>
wickedness, it must be the devil himself. She's sailed with England,<br>
the great <span class=SpellE>Cap'n</span> England, the pirate. She's been <span
class=GramE>at</span> Madagascar, and at<br>
Malabar, and Surinam, and Providence, and Portobello. She was at the<br>
fishing up of the wrecked plate ships. It's there she learned 'Pieces<br>
of eight,' and little wonder; three hundred and fifty thousand of '<span
class=SpellE>em</span>,<br>
Hawkins! She was at the boarding of the viceroy of the Indies out of<br>
Goa, she <span class=GramE>was;</span> and to look at her you would think she
was a babby. But<br>
you smelt powder--didn't you, <span class=SpellE>cap'n</span>?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Stand by to go about,&quot; the parrot would scream.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, she's a handsome craft, she is,&quot; the cook would say, and give
her<br>
sugar from his pocket, and then the bird would peck at the bars and<br>
swear straight on, passing belief for wickedness. &quot;There,&quot; John would<br>
add, &quot;you can't touch pitch and not be mucked, lad. Here's this poor old<br>
innocent bird o' mine swearing blue fire, and none the wiser, you may<br>
lay to that. She would swear the same, in a manner of speaking, before<br>
chaplain.&quot; And John would touch his forelock with a solemn way he had<br>
that made me think he was the best of men.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, the squire and Captain Smollett were still on pretty<br>
distant terms with one another. The squire made no bones about the<br>
matter; he despised the captain. The captain, on his part, never spoke<br>
but when he was spoken to, and then sharp and short and dry, and not a<br>
word wasted. He owned, when driven into a corner, that he seemed to have<br>
been wrong about the crew, that some of them were as brisk as he wanted<br>
to see and all had behaved <span class=GramE>fairly well</span>. As for the
ship, he had taken a<br>
downright fancy to her. &quot;She'll lie a point nearer the wind than a man<br>
has a right to expect of his own married wife, sir. But,&quot; he would add,<br>
&quot;all I say is, we're not home again, and I don't like the cruise.&quot;<br>
<br>
The squire, at this, would turn away and march up and down the deck,<br>
chin in air.<br>
<br>
&quot;A trifle more of that man,&quot; he would say, &quot;and I shall
explode.&quot;<br>
<br>
We had some heavy weather, which only proved the qualities of the<br>
HISPANIOLA. Every man on board seemed well content, and they must have<br>
been hard to please if they had been otherwise, for it is my belief<br>
there was never a ship's company so spoiled since Noah put to sea.<br>
Double grog was going on the least excuse; there was duff on odd days,<br>
as, for instance, if the squire heard it was any man's birthday, and<br>
always a barrel of apples standing broached in the waist for anyone to<br>
help himself that had a fancy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Never knew good come of it yet,&quot; the captain said to Dr. Livesey.<br>
&quot;Spoil forecastle hands, make devils. That's my belief.&quot;<br>
<br>
But good did come of the apple barrel, as you shall hear, for if it had<br>
not been for that, we should have had no note of warning and might all<br>
have perished by the hand of treachery.<br>
<br>
This was how it came about.<br>
<br>
We had run up the trades to get the wind of the island we were after--I<br>
am not allowed to be more plain--and now we were running down for it<br>
with a bright lookout day and night. It was about the last day of our<br>
outward voyage by the largest computation; some time that night, or at<br>
latest before noon of the morrow, we should sight the Treasure Island.<br>
We were heading S.S.W. and had a steady breeze abeam and a quiet sea.<br>
The HISPANIOLA rolled steadily, dipping her bowsprit now and then with<br>
a whiff of spray. All was drawing <span class=SpellE>alow</span> and aloft;
everyone was in the<br>
bravest spirits because we were now so near an end of the first part of<br>
our adventure.<br>
<br>
Now, just after sundown, when all my work was over and I was on my way<br>
to my berth, it occurred to me that I should like an apple. I ran on<br>
deck. The watch was all forward looking out for the island. The man at<br>
the helm was watching the luff of the sail and whistling away gently<br>
to himself, and that was the only sound excepting the swish of the sea<br>
against the bows and around the sides of the ship.<br>
<br>
In I got bodily into the apple barrel, and found there was scarce an<br>
apple left; but sitting down there in the dark, what with the sound of<br>
the waters and the rocking movement of the ship, I had either fallen<br>
asleep or was on the point of doing so when a heavy man sat down with<br>
rather a clash close by. The barrel shook as he leaned his shoulders<br>
against it, and I was just about to jump up when the man began to speak.<br>
It was Silver's voice, and before I had heard a dozen words, I would<br>
not have shown myself for all the world, but lay there, trembling and<br>
listening, in the extreme of fear and curiosity, for from these dozen<br>
words I understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended<br>
upon me alone.<br>

        <p>1. The atmosphere on the ship the night before their voyage began was bustling and filled with activity. The crew was busy stowing things in their places, and the squire's friends, including Mr. Blandly, came to wish them a safe journey. The boatswain sounded his pipe, and the crew began to prepare the ship for departure. It was a new and interesting experience for the narrator.</p>
        <p>2. Mr. Arrow's behavior during the voyage is problematic. He has no command among the men, and they do as they please with him. He starts appearing on deck with signs of drunkenness, including hazy eyes, red cheeks, and a stuttering tongue. He is repeatedly ordered below in disgrace, and his behavior is erratic, alternating between bouts of drunkenness and moments of sobriety. Eventually, one dark night during a head sea, he disappears from the ship and is seen no more. The captain comments that he must have gone overboard, and this event leads to the need for a new mate.</p>
        <p>3. Long John Silver is well-liked and respected by the crew. He carries a crutch with him, which he uses as needed, and he is skilled in cooking. He is kind and welcoming to the narrator, often inviting him to the galley. Long John Silver's parrot, named Cap'n Flint, is a fixture in the galley, and the parrot swears profusely. Long John Silver's background is hinted at; he had good schooling in his youth and can speak well when he chooses to. He is known for his bravery and is described as being as fierce as a lion. He has a reputation for having sailed with infamous pirates and has been to various dangerous places around the world. Despite his rough exterior, he is portrayed as a kind and caring person, especially towards the narrator.</p>

    <p class="w3-large"><strong>11. What I Heard in the Apple Barrel</strong></p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:15px; padding-left: 24px; padding-right: 24px; text-align: left;">
<br>
&quot;NO, not I,&quot; said Silver. &quot;Flint was <span class=SpellE>cap'n</span>;
I was quartermaster, along<br>
of my timber leg. The same broadside I lost my leg, old Pew lost his<br>
deadlights. It was a master surgeon, him that <span class=SpellE>ampytated</span>
me--out of<br>
college and all--Latin by the bucket, and what not; but he was hanged<br>
like a dog, and sun-dried like the rest, at Corso Castle. That<br>
was Roberts' men, that was, and <span class=SpellE>comed</span> of changing
names to their<br>
ships--ROYAL FORTUNE and so on. Now, what a ship was christened, so let<br>
her stay, I <span class=GramE>says</span>. So it was with the CASSANDRA, as
brought us all safe<br>
home from Malabar, after England took the viceroy of the Indies; so it<br>
was with the old WALRUS, Flint's old ship, as I've seen amuck with the<br>
red blood and fit to sink with gold.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah!&quot; cried another voice, that of the youngest hand on board, and<br>
evidently full of admiration. &quot;He was the flower of the flock, was<br>
Flint!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Davis was a man too, by all accounts,&quot; said Silver. &quot;I never
sailed<br>
along of him; first with England, then with Flint, that's my story;<br>
and now here on my own account, in a manner of speaking. I laid by nine<br>
hundred <span class=GramE>safe</span>, from England, and two thousand after
Flint. That <span class=SpellE>ain't</span> bad<br>
for a man before the mast--all safe in bank. '<span class=SpellE>Tain't</span>
earning now, it's<br>
saving does it, you may lay to that. Where's all England's men now? I<br>
<span class=SpellE>dunno</span>. Where's Flint's? Why, most on '<span
class=SpellE>em</span> aboard here, and glad to get<br>
the duff--been begging before that, some on '<span class=SpellE>em</span>. Old
Pew, as had lost<br>
his sight, and might have thought shame, spends twelve hundred pound in<br>
a year, like a lord in Parliament. Where is he now? Well, he's dead now<br>
and under hatches; but for two <span class=GramE>year</span> before that,
shiver my timbers,<br>
the man was starving! He begged, and he stole, and he cut throats, and<br>
starved at that, by the powers!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, it <span class=SpellE>ain't</span> much use, after all,&quot; said
the young seaman.<br>
<br>
&quot;'<span class=SpellE>Tain't</span> much use for fools, you may lay to
it--that, nor nothing,&quot;<br>
cried Silver. &quot;But now, you look here: you're young, you are, but you're<br>
as smart as paint. I see that when I set my eyes on you, and I'll talk<br>
to you like a man.&quot;<br>
<br>
You may imagine how I felt when I heard this abominable old rogue<br>
addressing another in the very same words of flattery as he had used<br>
to myself. I think, if I had been able, that I would have killed<br>
him through the barrel. Meantime, he ran on, little supposing he was<br>
overheard.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here it is about gentlemen of fortune. They <span class=GramE>lives</span>
rough, and they risk<br>
swinging, but they eat and drink like fighting-cocks, and when a cruise<br>
is done, why, it's hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings<br>
in their pockets. Now, the most goes for rum and a good fling, and to<br>
sea again in their shirts. But that's not the course I lay. I <span
class=GramE>puts</span> it<br>
all away, some here, some there, and none too much <span class=SpellE>anywheres</span>,
by reason<br>
of suspicion. I'm fifty, mark you; once back from this cruise, I set up<br>
gentleman in earnest. Time enough too, says you. Ah, but I've lived easy<br>
in the meantime, never denied myself o' nothing heart desires, and <span
class=SpellE>slep</span>'<br>
soft and ate dainty all my days but when at sea. And how did I begin?<br>
Before the mast, like you!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; said the other, &quot;but all the other money's gone now, <span
class=SpellE>ain't</span> it?<br>
You <span class=SpellE>daren't</span> show face in Bristol after this.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, where might you suppose it was?&quot; asked Silver derisively.<br>
<br>
&quot;At Bristol, in banks and places,&quot; answered his companion.<br>
<br>
&quot;It were,&quot; said the cook; &quot;it were when we weighed anchor. But
my old<br>
missis has it all by now. And the <span class=GramE>Spy-glass</span> is sold,
lease and goodwill<br>
and rigging; and the old girl's off to meet me. I would tell you where,<br>
for I trust you, but it'd make jealousy among the mates.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And can you trust your missis?&quot; asked the other.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gentlemen of fortune,&quot; returned the cook, &quot;usually trusts
little among<br>
themselves, and right they are, you may lay to it. But I have a way with<br>
me, I have. When a mate brings a slip on his cable--one as knows me, I<br>
mean--it won't be in the same world with old John. There was some that<br>
was feared of Pew, and some that was feared of Flint; but Flint his own<br>
self was feared of me. Feared he was, and proud. They <span class=GramE>was</span>
the roughest<br>
crew afloat, was Flint's; the devil himself would have been feared to go<br>
to sea with them. Well now, I tell you, I'm not a boasting man, and you<br>
<span class=SpellE>seen</span> yourself how easy I keep company, but when I was
quartermaster,<br>
LAMBS wasn't the word for Flint's old buccaneers. Ah, you may be sure of<br>
yourself in old John's ship.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I tell you now,&quot; replied the lad, &quot;I didn't half a
quarter like<br>
the job till I had this talk with you, John; but there's my hand on it<br>
now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And a brave lad you were, and smart too,&quot; answered Silver, shaking<br>
hands so heartily that all the barrel shook, &quot;and a finer figurehead for<br>
a gentleman of fortune I never clapped my eyes on.&quot;<br>
<br>
By this time I had begun to understand the meaning of their terms. By a<br>
&quot;gentleman of fortune&quot; they plainly meant neither more nor less than
a<br>
common pirate, and the little scene that I had overheard was the last<br>
act in the corruption of one of the honest hands--perhaps of the last<br>
one left aboard. But on this <span class=GramE>point</span> I was soon to be
relieved, for Silver<br>
giving a little whistle, a third man strolled up and sat down by the<br>
party.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dick's square,&quot; said Silver.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, I <span class=SpellE>know'd</span> Dick was square,&quot; returned
the voice of the coxswain,<br>
Israel Hands. &quot;He's no fool, is Dick.&quot; And he turned his quid and
spat.<br>
&quot;But look here,&quot; he went on, &quot;here's what I want to know,
Barbecue: how<br>
long are we a-going to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat? I've had<br>
<span class=SpellE>a'most</span> enough o' <span class=SpellE>Cap'n</span>
Smollett; he's hazed me long enough, by thunder!<br>
I want to go into that cabin, I do. I want their pickles and wines, and<br>
that.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Israel,&quot; said Silver, &quot;your head <span class=SpellE>ain't</span>
much account, nor ever was. But<br>
you're able to hear, I reckon; leastways, your ears is big enough.<br>
Now, here's what I say: you'll berth forward, and you'll live hard, and<br>
you'll speak soft, and you'll keep sober till I give the word; and you<br>
may lay to that, my son.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I don't say no, do I?&quot; growled the coxswain. &quot;What I say
is,<br>
when? That's what I say.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;When! By the powers!&quot; cried Silver. &quot;Well now, if you want to
know,<br>
I'll tell you when. The last moment I can manage, and that's when.<br>
Here's a first-rate seaman, <span class=SpellE>Cap'n</span> Smollett, sails the
blessed ship for<br>
us. Here's this squire and doctor with a map and such--I don't know<br>
where it is, do I? No more do you, says you. Well then, I mean this<br>
squire and doctor shall find the stuff, and help us to get it aboard,<br>
by the powers. Then we'll see. If I was sure of you all, sons of double<br>
Dutchmen, I'd have <span class=SpellE>Cap'n</span> Smollett navigate us
half-way back again before<br>
I struck.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, we're all seamen aboard here, I should think,&quot; said the <span
class=GramE>lad</span> Dick.<br>
<br>
&quot;We're all forecastle hands, you mean,&quot; snapped Silver. &quot;We can
steer<br>
a course, but who's to set one? That's what all you gentlemen split on,<br>
first and last. If I had my way, I'd have <span class=SpellE>Cap'n</span>
Smollett work us back<br>
into the trades at least; then we'd have no blessed miscalculations and<br>
a spoonful of water a day. But I know the sort you are. I'll finish with<br>
'<span class=SpellE>em</span> at the island, as <span class=SpellE>soon's</span>
the <span class=SpellE>blunt's</span> on board, and a pity it is. But<br>
you're never happy till you're drunk. Split my sides, I've a sick heart<br>
to sail with the likes of you!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Easy all, Long John,&quot; cried Israel. &quot;<span class=GramE>Who's</span>
a-<span class=SpellE>crossin</span>' of you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, how many tall ships, think ye, now, have I seen laid aboard? And<br>
how many brisk lads drying in the sun at Execution Dock?&quot; cried Silver.<br>
&quot;And all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry. You hear me? I <span
class=SpellE>seen</span><br>
a thing or two at sea, I have. If you would <span class=SpellE>on'y</span> lay
your course, and a<br>
<span class=SpellE>p'int</span> to windward, you would ride in carriages, you
would. But not you!<br>
I know you. You'll have your mouthful of rum <span class=GramE>tomorrow, and</span>
go hang.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Everybody <span class=SpellE>knowed</span> you was a kind of a <span
class=SpellE>chapling</span>, John; but there's others<br>
as could hand and steer as well as you,&quot; said Israel. &quot;They liked a
bit<br>
o' fun, they did. They <span class=GramE>wasn't</span> so high and dry, <span
class=SpellE>nohow</span>, but took their<br>
fling, like jolly companions <span class=SpellE>every one</span>.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So?&quot; says Silver. &quot;Well, and where are they now? Pew was that
sort,<br>
and he died a <span class=GramE>beggar-man</span>. Flint was, and he died of
rum at Savannah. Ah,<br>
they <span class=GramE>was</span> a sweet crew, they was! <span class=SpellE>On'y</span>,
where are they?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;<span class=GramE>But,</span>&quot; asked Dick, &quot;when we do lay '<span
class=SpellE>em</span> athwart, what are we to do with<br>
'<span class=SpellE>em</span>, anyhow?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There's the man for me!&quot; cried the cook admiringly. &quot;That's
what I call<br>
business. Well, what would you think? Put '<span class=SpellE>em</span> ashore
like maroons? That<br>
would have been England's way. Or cut '<span class=SpellE>em</span> down like
that much pork? That<br>
would have been Flint's, or Billy Bones's.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Billy was the man for that,&quot; said Israel. &quot;'Dead men don't
bite,' says<br>
he. Well, he's dead now <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>hisself</span></span>;
he knows the long and short on it now;<br>
and if ever a rough hand come to port, it was Billy.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Right you are,&quot; said Silver; &quot;rough and ready. But mark you
here,<br>
I'm an easy man--I'm quite the gentleman, says you; but this time it's<br>
serious. <span class=SpellE>Dooty</span> is <span class=SpellE>dooty</span>,
mates. I give my vote--death. When I'm in<br>
<span class=SpellE>Parlyment</span> and riding in my coach, I don't want none
of these sea-lawyers<br>
in the cabin a-coming home, unlooked for, like the devil at prayers.<br>
Wait is what I say; but when the time comes, why, let her rip!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;John,&quot; cries the coxswain, &quot;you're a man!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You'll say so, Israel when you see,&quot; said Silver. &quot;Only one
thing I<br>
claim--I claim Trelawney. I'll wring his calf's head off his body with<br>
these hands, Dick!&quot; he added, breaking off. &quot;You just jump up, like a<br>
sweet lad, and get me an apple, to wet my pipe like.&quot;<br>
<br>
You may fancy the terror I was in! I should have leaped out and run for<br>
it if I had found the strength, but my limbs and heart alike misgave me.<br>
I heard Dick begin to rise, and then someone seemingly stopped him, and<br>
the voice of Hands exclaimed, &quot;Oh, stow that! Don't you get sucking of<br>
that bilge, John. Let's have a go of the rum.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dick,&quot; said Silver, &quot;I trust you. I've a gauge on the keg,
mind.<br>
There's the key; you fill a pannikin and bring it up.&quot;<br>
<br>
Terrified as I was, I could not help thinking to myself that this must<br>
have been how Mr. Arrow got the strong waters that destroyed him.<br>
<br>
Dick was gone but a little while, and during his absence Israel spoke<br>
straight on in the cook's ear. It was but a word or two that I could<br>
catch, and yet I gathered some important news, for besides other scraps<br>
that tended to the same purpose, this whole clause was audible: &quot;Not<br>
another man of <span class=SpellE>them'll</span> <span class=SpellE>jine</span>.&quot;
Hence there were still faithful men on<br>
board.<br>
<br>
When Dick returned, one after another of the trio took the pannikin and<br>
drank--one &quot;To luck,&quot; another with a &quot;Here's to old Flint,&quot;
and Silver<br>
himself saying, in a kind of song, &quot;Here's to ourselves, and hold your<br>
luff, plenty of prizes and plenty of duff.&quot;<br>
<br>
Just then a sort of brightness fell upon me in the barrel, and looking<br>
up, I found the moon had risen and was silvering the mizzen-top and<br>
shining white on the luff of the fore-sail; and almost at the same time<br>
the voice of the lookout shouted, &quot;Land <span class=SpellE>ho</span>!&quot;<br>

        <p>1. Long John Silver is one of the characters in the passage, and he is addressing his fellow crew members. In this passage, Long John Silver reveals that he was the quartermaster on a ship captained by Flint, who was a notorious pirate. He talks about losing his leg during a broadside and mentions the fate of a surgeon who amputated his leg. He also mentions that many pirates, including Flint's crew, changed the names of their ships. Long John Silver expresses a preference for keeping a ship's original name.</p>
        <p>2. Long John Silver's attitude toward money and wealth is practical and calculating. He mentions that he has saved a considerable sum of money, first from England and then after serving with Flint. He emphasizes the importance of saving money rather than earning it. Silver plans to use his savings to set himself up as a gentleman "in earnest" once this cruise is over. He believes in enjoying life's comforts and indulgences, but he also keeps a suspicious eye on his savings, spreading them around in different places.</p>
        <p>3. In this passage, Silver, Israel Hands, and Dick are discussing their plans and actions. Israel Hands expresses frustration with Captain Smollett and wants to enter the cabin to access the pickles and wines. Silver cautions him to wait and behave until the right time comes. Silver discusses the importance of duty and obedience among the crew members. He also mentions that they will deal with any dissenters once they reach the island. Meanwhile, Dick is sent to fetch an apple to wet Silver's pipe, and during this time, Israel and Silver engage in private conversation, with Israel mentioning that not another man will join their cause. The passage highlights the tension and uncertainty among the crew members as they plan their next steps.</p>

<br>
THERE was a great rush of feet across the deck. I could hear people<br>
tumbling up from the cabin and the forecastle, and slipping in an<br>
instant outside my barrel, <span class=GramE>I</span> dived behind the
fore-sail, made a double<br>
towards the stern, and came out upon the open deck in time to join<br>
Hunter and Dr. Livesey in the rush for the weather bow.<br>
<br>
There all hands were already congregated. A belt of fog had lifted<br>
almost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon. Away to the<br>
south-west of us we saw two low hills, about a couple of miles apart,<br>
and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill, whose peak was<br>
still buried in the fog. All three seemed sharp and conical in figure.<br>
<br>
So much I saw, almost in a dream, for I had not yet recovered from my<br>
horrid fear of a minute or two before. And then I heard the voice of<br>
Captain Smollett issuing orders. The HISPANIOLA was laid a couple of<br>
points nearer the wind and now sailed a course that would just clear the<br>
island on the east.<br>
<br>
&quot;And now, men,&quot; said the captain, when all was sheeted home,
&quot;has any<br>
one of you ever seen that land ahead?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have, sir,&quot; said Silver. &quot;I've watered there with a trader I
was cook<br>
in.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The anchorage is on the south, behind an islet, I fancy?&quot; asked the<br>
captain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, sir; Skeleton Island they <span class=GramE>calls</span> it. It <span
class=GramE>were</span> a main place for<br>
pirates once, and a hand we had on board <span class=SpellE>knowed</span> all
their names for it.<br>
That hill to the <span class=SpellE>nor'ard</span> they calls the Fore-mast
Hill; there are three<br>
hills in a row running <span class=SpellE>south'ard</span>--fore, main, and
mizzen, sir. But the<br>
main--that's the big un, with the cloud on it--they usually <span class=GramE>calls</span><br>
the Spy-glass, by reason of a lookout they kept when they was in the<br>
anchorage cleaning, for it's there they cleaned their ships, sir, asking<br>
your pardon.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have a chart here,&quot; says Captain Smollett. &quot;See if that's the
place.&quot;<br>
<br>
Long John's eyes burned in his head as he took the chart, but by the<br>
fresh look of the paper I knew he was doomed to disappointment. This<br>
was not the map we found in Billy Bones's chest, but an accurate copy,<br>
complete in all things--names and heights and soundings--with the single<br>
exception of the red crosses and the written notes. Sharp as must have<br>
been his annoyance, Silver had the strength of mind to hide it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said he, &quot;this is the spot, to be sure, and very
prettily<br>
<span class=SpellE>drawed</span> out. Who might have done that, I wonder? The
pirates were too<br>
ignorant, I reckon. Aye, here it is: 'Capt. Kidd's Anchorage'--just<br>
the name my shipmate called it. There's a <span class=GramE>strong current runs</span>
along the<br>
south, and then away <span class=SpellE>nor'ard</span> up the west coast. <span
class=GramE>Right</span> you was, sir,&quot;<br>
says he, &quot;to haul your wind and keep the weather of the island.<br>
Leastways, if such was your intention as to enter and careen, and there<br>
<span class=SpellE>ain't</span> no better place for that in these waters.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you, my man,&quot; says Captain Smollett. &quot;I'll ask you later
on to<br>
give us <span class=GramE>a</span> help. You may go.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was surprised at the coolness with which John avowed his knowledge<br>
of the island, and I own I was half-frightened when I saw him drawing<br>
nearer to myself. He did not know, to be sure, that I had overheard his<br>
council from the apple barrel, and yet I had by this time taken such a<br>
horror of his cruelty, duplicity, and power that I could scarce conceal<br>
a shudder when he laid his hand upon my arm.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah,&quot; says he, &quot;this here is a sweet spot, this island--a sweet
spot for<br>
a lad to get ashore on. You'll bathe, and you'll climb trees, and you'll<br>
hunt goats, you will; and you'll get aloft on them hills like a goat<br>
yourself. Why, it makes me young again. I was going to forget my timber<br>
leg, I was. It's a pleasant thing to be young and have ten toes, and you<br>
may lay to that. When you want to go a bit of exploring, you just ask<br>
old John, and he'll put up a snack for you to take along.&quot;<br>
<br>
And clapping me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder, he hobbled off<br>
forward and went below.<br>
<br>
Captain Smollett, the squire, and Dr. Livesey were talking together on<br>
the quarter-deck, and anxious as I was to tell them my story, I durst<br>
not interrupt them openly. While I was still casting about in my<br>
thoughts to find some probable excuse, Dr. Livesey called me to his<br>
side. He had left his pipe below, and being a slave to tobacco, had<br>
meant that I should fetch it; but as soon as I was near enough to speak<br>
and not to be overheard, I broke immediately, &quot;Doctor, let me speak. Get<br>
the captain and squire down to the cabin, and then make some pretence to<br>
send for me. I have terrible news.&quot;<br>
<br>
The doctor changed countenance a little, but next moment he was master<br>
of himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you, Jim,&quot; said he quite loudly, &quot;that was all I wanted
to know,&quot;<br>
as if he had asked me a question.<br>
<br>
And with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two. They<br>
spoke together for a little, and though none of them started, or raised<br>
his voice, or so much as whistled, it was plain enough that Dr. Livesey<br>
had communicated my request, for the next thing that I heard was the<br>
captain giving an order to Job Anderson, and all hands were piped on<br>
deck.<br>
<br>
&quot;My lads,&quot; said Captain Smollett, &quot;I've a word to say to you.
This<br>
land that we have sighted is the place we have been sailing for. Mr.<br>
Trelawney, being a very open-handed gentleman, as we all know, has just<br>
asked me a word or two, and as I was able to tell him that every man on<br>
board had done his duty, <span class=SpellE>alow</span> and aloft, as I never
ask to see it done<br>
better, why, he and I and the doctor are going below to the cabin to<br>
drink YOUR health and luck, and you'll have grog served out for you to<br>
drink OUR health and luck. I'll tell you what I think of this: I think<br>
it handsome. And if you think as I do, you'll give a good sea-cheer for<br>
the gentleman that does it.&quot;<br>
<br>
The cheer followed--that was a matter of course; but it rang out so full<br>
and hearty that I confess I could hardly believe these same men were<br>
plotting for our blood.<br>
<br>
&quot;One more cheer for <span class=SpellE>Cap'n</span> Smollett,&quot; cried
Long John when the first had<br>
subsided.<br>
<br>
And this also was given with a will.<br>
<br>
On the top of that the three gentlemen went below, and not long after,<br>
word was sent forward that Jim Hawkins was wanted in the cabin.<br>
<br>
I found them all three seated round the table, a bottle of Spanish wine<br>
and some raisins before them, and the doctor smoking away, with his wig<br>
on his lap, and that, I knew, was a sign that he was agitated. The stern<br>
window was open, for it was a warm night, and you could see the moon<br>
shining behind on the ship's wake.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, Hawkins,&quot; said the squire, &quot;you have something to say.
Speak up.&quot;<br>
<br>
I did as I was bid, and as short as I could make it, told the whole<br>
details of Silver's conversation. Nobody interrupted me till I was done,<br>
nor did any one of the three of them make so much as a movement, but<br>
they kept their eyes upon my face from first to last.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jim,&quot; said Dr. Livesey, &quot;take a seat.&quot;<br>
<br>
And they made me sit down at table beside them, poured me out a glass of<br>
wine, filled my hands with raisins, and all three, one after the other,<br>
and each with a bow, drank my good health, and their service to me, for<br>
my luck and courage.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, captain,&quot; said the squire, &quot;you were right, and I was
wrong. I own<br>
myself an ass, and I await your orders.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No more an ass than I, sir,&quot; returned the captain. &quot;I never
heard of a<br>
crew that meant to mutiny but what showed signs before, for any man that<br>
had an eye in his head to see the mischief and take steps according. But<br>
this crew,&quot; he added, &quot;beats me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Captain,&quot; said the doctor, &quot;with your permission, that's
Silver. A very<br>
remarkable man.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He'd look remarkably well from a <span class=GramE>yard-arm</span>,
sir,&quot; returned the captain.<br>
&quot;But this is talk; this don't lead to anything. I see three or four<br>
points, and with Mr. Trelawney's permission, I'll name them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You, sir, are the captain. It is for you to speak,&quot; says Mr.
Trelawney<br>
grandly.<br>
<br>
&quot;First point,&quot; began Mr. Smollett. &quot;We must go on, because we
can't turn<br>
back. If I gave the word to go about, they would rise at once. Second<br>
point, we have time before us--at least until this treasure's found.<br>
Third point, there are faithful hands. Now, sir, it's got to come<br>
to blows sooner or later, and what I propose is to take time by the<br>
forelock, as the saying is, and come to blows some fine day when they<br>
least expect it. We can count, I take it, on your own home servants, Mr.<br>
Trelawney?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As upon myself,&quot; declared the squire.<br>
<br>
&quot;Three,&quot; reckoned the captain; &quot;ourselves make seven, counting
Hawkins<br>
here. Now, about the honest hands?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Most likely Trelawney's own men,&quot; said the doctor; &quot;those he
had picked<br>
up for himself before he lit on Silver.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nay,&quot; replied the squire. &quot;Hands was one of mine.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I did think I could have trusted Hands,&quot; added the captain.<br>
<br>
&quot;And to think that they're all Englishmen!&quot; broke out the squire.
&quot;Sir,<br>
I could find it in my heart to blow the ship up.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, gentlemen,&quot; said the captain, &quot;the best that I can say is
not<br>
much. We must lay to, if you please, and keep a bright lookout. It's<br>
trying on a man, I know. It would be pleasanter to come to blows. But<br>
there's no help for it till we know our men. Lay to, and whistle for a<br>
wind, that's my view.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Jim here,&quot; said the doctor, &quot;can help us more than anyone. The
men are<br>
not shy with him, and Jim is a noticing lad.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hawkins, I put prodigious faith in you,&quot; added the squire.<br>
<br>
I began to feel <span class=GramE>pretty desperate</span> at this, for I felt
altogether<br>
helpless; and yet, by an odd train of circumstances, it was indeed<br>
through me that safety came. In the meantime, talk as we pleased, there<br>
were only seven out of the twenty-six on whom we knew we could rely; and<br>
out of these seven one was a boy, so that the grown men on our side were<br>
six to their nineteen.<br>

        <p>1. Jim Hawkins joins Hunter and Dr. Livesey on the deck after hearing a great rush of feet across the deck. He had been hiding in a barrel and had just emerged. The rush of feet was caused by people coming up from the cabin and the forecastle. It is nighttime, and a belt of fog has lifted, revealing two low hills to the southwest and a third, higher hill behind them, still partly covered by fog. Captain Smollett is giving orders to change the ship's course, and the crew is gathered on deck.</p>
        <p>2. Long John Silver reveals that Skeleton Island is the place they have been sailing for. He mentions that the anchorage is on the south side of the island, behind an islet. He describes the three hills on the island as the Fore-mast Hill, the Main Hill, and the Mizzen Hill. Captain Smollett confirms the island's location by showing a chart to Silver, who recognizes it as the spot. The chart has the name "Capt. Kidd's Anchorage" on it, matching what Silver's shipmate had called it. Silver also mentions the strong currents in the area.</p>
        <p>3. Captain Smollett proposes a plan to the crew, acknowledging their hard work and loyalty. He suggests that they are sailing toward the island they have been seeking, and Mr. Trelawney, being generous, wants to celebrate their good fortune. Smollett suggests that they will go below to the cabin to drink a toast to the crew's health and luck. The crew reacts with enthusiasm and gives a hearty cheer for Captain Smollett. Long John Silver also calls for another cheer for the captain. This shows the crew's loyalty to Smollett, despite their earlier mutinous discussions.</p>
