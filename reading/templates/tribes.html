        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us</strong> by Seth Godin is an inspiring manifesto on leadership and community building. Published in 2008, the book emphasizes the power of tribes—groups of people connected by a shared interest or purpose—and the opportunities for anyone to step up and lead. Godin challenges the traditional notions of leadership and demonstrates how the internet and social media have made it easier than ever to form and lead tribes. This book is an essential read for anyone looking to inspire change, create movements, or lead with purpose.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Summary</strong></p>
        <p>Godin defines a tribe as a group of people united by a shared idea, goal, or passion. The book outlines how individuals can harness the power of tribes to drive innovation, inspire action, and create lasting impact.</p>

        <p><strong>1. The Need for Leadership</strong><br>
        Godin argues that tribes thrive when they have strong, passionate leaders. Leadership is not about authority or titles; it’s about taking initiative, inspiring others, and challenging the status quo.</p>

        <p><strong>2. The Power of Connection</strong><br>
        Tribes are built on connections. Leaders connect tribe members to one another and to the shared purpose that binds them. Technology and social media have amplified the ability to build and lead tribes across geographic and cultural boundaries.</p>

        <p><strong>3. The Role of Faith and Belief</strong><br>
        Great tribes are driven by shared beliefs and values. Leaders must articulate a clear vision and inspire others to believe in the mission.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Embracing Change</strong><br>
        Godin emphasizes that change is essential for growth. Tribes often emerge in response to dissatisfaction with the status quo, and leaders must embrace the courage to challenge norms and drive transformation.</p>

        <p><strong>5. Overcoming Fear</strong><br>
        Fear is one of the biggest obstacles to leadership. Godin encourages aspiring leaders to confront fear and take bold steps toward their vision.</p>

        <p><strong>6. The Importance of Stories</strong><br>
        Stories are a powerful tool for inspiring and uniting tribes. Leaders use stories to communicate their vision, share successes, and build a sense of identity and belonging.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Story</strong></p>
        <p>One memorable story in the book involves the creation of the "It Gets Better Project," a movement aimed at supporting LGBTQ+ youth. By leveraging online platforms and shared stories, the project grew into a global tribe that inspired hope and change. This example highlights the power of storytelling and the ability of tribes to create meaningful impact.</p>
