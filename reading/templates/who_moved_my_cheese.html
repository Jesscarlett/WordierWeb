        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Who Moved My Cheese?</strong> by Spencer Johnson is a simple yet profound fable that explores how individuals react to change in their lives. Through a story about two mice, Sniff and Scurry, and two tiny people, Hem and Haw, the book illustrates the different ways people deal with change. The "cheese" in the story represents what we want in life—whether it’s success, happiness, love, or wealth—and the maze symbolizes the environment in which we search for these things. The core message of the book is that change is inevitable, and it is our ability to adapt to change that determines our success and happiness. Johnson emphasizes that we can choose how we respond to change, and by embracing it rather than resisting it, we can achieve greater fulfillment and personal growth.</p>

        <p class="w3-large"><strong>Summary</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Who Moved My Cheese?</strong> is a motivational book that uses a parable to teach valuable life lessons about change, fear, and adaptation. The story is set in a maze, where four characters search for cheese, a metaphor for their goals, happiness, and desires.</p>

        <p><strong>The Characters</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sniff</strong> and <strong>Scurry</strong>: Two mice who represent simple, instinctual beings. They are quick to adapt to change and move forward without overthinking it.</li>
            <li><strong>Hem</strong> and <strong>Haw</strong>: Two tiny people who symbolize more complex beings, with human emotions and thoughts. Hem resists change, while Haw learns to embrace it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>The Story</strong></p>
        <p>The characters live in a maze where they search for cheese. They find a large stash of cheese at "Cheese Station C," and each character reacts differently to the sudden disappearance of the cheese.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sniff</strong> and <strong>Scurry</strong>, the mice, quickly adapt and start searching for new cheese without hesitation. They are not bogged down by overthinking and are quick to take action.</li>
            <li><strong>Hem</strong>, however, is devastated by the disappearance of the cheese. He feels entitled to the cheese and refuses to leave, convinced that the cheese will come back. He is paralyzed by fear and resistance to change.</li>
            <li><strong>Haw</strong>, after much reluctance and fear, begins to venture out into the maze to find new cheese. Along the way, he learns that change is inevitable and that by embracing it, he can find new opportunities and greater fulfillment.</li>
